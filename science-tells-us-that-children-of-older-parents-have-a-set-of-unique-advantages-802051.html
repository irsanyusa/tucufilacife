While the childbirth delay has been attributed to&nbsp;financial preparedness and the desire for career growth, <a href=#>experts</a> discovered that a&nbsp;child’s IQ&nbsp;can be&nbsp;affected if&nbsp;the mom or&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;more mature in&nbsp;age.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>have found some interesting pieces of&nbsp;research that tell&nbsp;us how children born to&nbsp;older parents can actually be&nbsp;mentally and emotionally affected by&nbsp;age differences.</p><p><h2>Parents play a&nbsp;big role in&nbsp;the intelligence of&nbsp;their children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/784/5e0/f36c44546980a78ecca718f13c.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Part of&nbsp;one’s intellect is&nbsp;actually hereditary. Even though <a href=#>20%-40%</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s intelligence is&nbsp;inherited, it’s highly <a href=#>likely</a> that 2&nbsp;intelligent parents will raise an&nbsp;intelligent child. However, recent studies revealed that a&nbsp;parent’s age has a&nbsp;significant effect on&nbsp;the cognitive intelligence of&nbsp;their children.</p><p class=adme-img-description>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple where the father is&nbsp;significantly older (beyond the age of&nbsp;50), it&nbsp;has been <a href=#>found</a> that there are increased risks of&nbsp;failing grades and lower educational attainment. On&nbsp;the other hand, a&nbsp;child born to&nbsp;an&nbsp;older mom has a&nbsp;higher <a href=#>likelihood</a> of&nbsp;good intellectual development and better school performance. A&nbsp;high&nbsp;IQ can be&nbsp;attributed to&nbsp;the chance of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;more life-experienced and career-successful mother who can help intellectually stimulate the child in&nbsp;a&nbsp;positive way; while a&nbsp;poor&nbsp;IQ was found to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;possible result of&nbsp;genetic mutations that occur in&nbsp;older men.</p><p><h2>The parents’ ages can have an&nbsp;effect on&nbsp;the physical well-being of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/211/7bf/07dd005f75a0521d5d27b7c6f7.jpg><p>Multiple <a href=#>studies</a> have shown that older parents can be&nbsp;the cause of&nbsp;health risks and genetic mutations in&nbsp;their children, such as&nbsp;<a href=#>premature</a> births and developmental <a href=#>disorders</a>. While this research may seem alarming, similar <a href=#>results</a> were also present in&nbsp;young mothers under the age of&nbsp;25.</p><p>In&nbsp;contrast, medical experts have found that the older the mother&nbsp;is, the <a href=#>less likely</a> the child will suffer from injuries or&nbsp;hospitalizations. Another <a href=#>study</a> has mentioned that children born to&nbsp;older parents are more likely to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;longer and healthier life because they have mutations that protect the DNA, which can get passed on&nbsp;to&nbsp;future generations as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Parents have a&nbsp;big impact on&nbsp;the mental health of&nbsp;their children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/565/f0e/bef9a650729ec5bde71a602614.jpg><p>A&nbsp;big <a href=# title=fear data-link=tag>fear</a> for children of&nbsp;older parents and perhaps even the parents themselves is&nbsp;having to&nbsp;deal with one’s demise. A&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> revealed that when parents conceive at&nbsp;older ages, especially in&nbsp;the late forties and early fifties, there’s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chance that the child will have to&nbsp;deal with parental loss at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age, which can affect his or&nbsp;her mental health and well-being.</p><p>Despite this looming overthought, experts explain that because older parents are more likely to&nbsp;have more stability in&nbsp;their lives, their children will grow up&nbsp;in&nbsp;this same stability and, therefore, will have fewer mental health issues.</p><p>On&nbsp;the flip side, being a&nbsp;parent at&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely young age can also have a&nbsp;negative impact on&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s mental health. Younger parents were <a href=#>discovered</a> to&nbsp;spend less quality time with their children due to&nbsp;work, which was linked to&nbsp;negative effects on&nbsp;the family relationship and the child’s emotions. In&nbsp;addition, children born to&nbsp;teen parents were <a href=#>found</a> to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;increased difficulty in&nbsp;dealing with their emotions and behaviors due to&nbsp;the fact that the parents themselves were not yet settled in&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;parent’s age can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;factor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s social life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66c/ae8/072e0f547fac80ca4cb5544218.jpg><p>One might assume that having a&nbsp;more senior parent makes the child’s life more socially awkward.
