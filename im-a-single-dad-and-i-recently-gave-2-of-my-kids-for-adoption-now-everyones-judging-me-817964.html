He&nbsp;has recently put two of&nbsp;his kids up&nbsp;for adoption, and the details of&nbsp;his story made our hearts shrink. The man added that people are judging him for the step he&nbsp;made. He&nbsp;wrote to&nbsp;us to&nbsp;seek advice from&nbsp;us and our readers about what we’d have done if&nbsp;we’d been in&nbsp;his shoes.</p><p><h2>The man opened his letter telling about his complicated family background.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d2/346/ac5a285a1b8bc369c3ee33b68b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man named Greg, who’s 45&nbsp;years old, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, and while telling his story, he&nbsp;sounded really desperate and hurt. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;has recently become an&nbsp;object for a&nbsp;constant people’s judgement. Even his relatives have become appalled by&nbsp;his decision towards his children, and his ex-wife stepped into the game, too.</p><p>Greg said that he&nbsp;now feels absolutely wretched, and he&nbsp;needs the words of&nbsp;advice and support from other people more than anything in&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;explained a&nbsp;little bit about his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> background. Greg wrote, «I&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;kids in&nbsp;total, 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them are from the marriage with my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;Maggie and 1&nbsp;with my&nbsp;wife Lilly.»</p><p>It&nbsp;all seemed like a&nbsp;normal family story, until Greg started telling&nbsp;us the details in&nbsp;his letter. The man wrote, «The kids&nbsp;I have with Maggie are a&nbsp;son Fred who’s 13&nbsp;and daughter Stella, she’s 10. They both have severe disabilities to&nbsp;the point neither of&nbsp;them can even live and function without a&nbsp;caregiver.»</p><p>Greg explained that his son Fred cannot walk, or&nbsp;even hold items. His daughter Stella cannot walk, talk, hold items and can’t chew food.</p><p>The man wrote, «Both kids need diaper changing and many other things. My&nbsp;ex-wife Maggie left me&nbsp;and the kids and had an&nbsp;affair with another man when Stella was just 1&nbsp;year old. She preferred to&nbsp;cut all contacts with me&nbsp;and most of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family. I&nbsp;made attempts to&nbsp;take Maggie to&nbsp;court for child support, but&nbsp;I lost the case.»</p><p><h2>Greg’s situation was desperate, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;cope with 2&nbsp;kids as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45c/d27/288768535db1717c2080c1dc02.jpg><p>Greg confessed in&nbsp;his letter that coping with 2&nbsp;kids with special needs was very hard for him. He&nbsp;was under permanent moral pressure, and his obligations were only getting bigger, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;think about everything in&nbsp;his family now. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;provide for the kids and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their caregiver at&nbsp;the same time, and the man admitted that he&nbsp;was exhausted.</p><p>He&nbsp;admitted in&nbsp;his letter that his mental state has come to&nbsp;that point that he&nbsp;found it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> the kids and connect with them. The man explained,"I read and tried to&nbsp;keep conversations with both kids separately and with each other for long hours ever since they were very small. But they showed zero emotion towards me&nbsp;and when Fred sometimes responded with a&nbsp;grumble, Stella is&nbsp;totally non-verbal.«</p><p>The man said that tried his best and took an&nbsp;active part in&nbsp;his kids’ development and learning, but it&nbsp;didn’t bring any visible result, and he&nbsp;felt like he&nbsp;was slowly giving&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;wrote, «It’s not like they were totally isolated in&nbsp;their own worlds. But both kids just never showed any single emotion towards me&nbsp;and only&nbsp;me. When my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;or&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents would talk to&nbsp;them, they would show some kind of&nbsp;emotion, and&nbsp;I saw them even smile at&nbsp;times.»</p><p>The man explained that both kids behaved like they didn’t know who Greg was. At&nbsp;the same time, the man highlighted his own feelings, saying, «I&nbsp;always wanted what’s best for the two.»</p><p><h2>The man finally made a&nbsp;decision that was painful for him, but he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;choice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80c/c33/73cf6d51708545e92da9fa9897.jpg><p>Greg wrote that in&nbsp;the meantime, there were positive changes in&nbsp;his own life. He&nbsp;met his now wife, Lilly, when Fred was 7&nbsp;and Stella was 4. The man wrote, «We&nbsp;got married and just a&nbsp;few years after we&nbsp;had our son, Todd. My&nbsp;wife Lilly has always been an&nbsp;amazing person. She helped me&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;Fred and Stella, even when&nbsp;I told her she wasn’t obliged to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.»</p><p>Greg felt like he&nbsp;couldn’t take care of&nbsp;the kids any longer. He&nbsp;explained, «I&nbsp;just couldn’t financially aid them and&nbsp;I couldn’t even love them like they were my&nbsp;kids anymore. I&nbsp;barely had time to&nbsp;spend with my&nbsp;small son Todd, and this has also affected my&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with Fred and Stella to&nbsp;the point where&nbsp;I started ignoring their cries.»</p><p>Greg has made a&nbsp;tough decision to&nbsp;put them up&nbsp;for adoption. His wife Lilly understood and supported his choice. But Greg revealed that his family have shamed him and many of&nbsp;them just cut contact with him. He&nbsp;says, «I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;explain them my&nbsp;reasons, but they would never listen. They all think I’m guilty, when in&nbsp;fact, they never even offered me&nbsp;any help.»</p><p>To&nbsp;crown it&nbsp;all, Greg’s ex-wife Maggie is&nbsp;also getting involved after 9&nbsp;years of&nbsp;ignoring him and their kids. Greg’s sister had told her about Greg’s decision, and Maggie now became very active.</p><p>The man closed his letter, saying, «I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;clue on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;handle this all, and Maggie has even threatened to&nbsp;take me&nbsp;to&nbsp;court over this. I&nbsp;do not regret my&nbsp;actions, and&nbsp;I don’t feel sorry for what I&nbsp;did.»</p><p><h2>The man described his feelings about his kids now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca9/5c3/f121fe5b9f8b15f98e6ee7e8ca.jpg><p>Greg added that many people are now saying that he&nbsp;just wants a&nbsp;healthy child and not the other two.</p><p>He&nbsp;explained, «I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;keep Fred and Stella around, but it’s already taking a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wellbeing as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;my&nbsp;family’s. Both kids didn’t show any emotion or&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I tried to&nbsp;talk and spend time with them, they even reacted more to&nbsp;cartoons than&nbsp;me.»</p><p>Greg added that he&nbsp;missed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;milestones for his youngest son Todd because of&nbsp;his older siblings, who seemed to&nbsp;consume all of&nbsp;his attention. Greg said, «I&nbsp;missed his first steps, his first word, and&nbsp;I even missed his birth.»</p><p>The man said that he&nbsp;will of&nbsp;course dearly miss Fred and Stella, but he&nbsp;sincerely believes that it’s what’s best for them both and him.</p><p><h2>We’d advise Greg to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;his heart and common sense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f1/ec2/1849815736803eaa41b69e3de5.jpg><p>We’re very grateful to&nbsp;Greg for opening up&nbsp;to&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;know it&nbsp;wasn’t easy for him to&nbsp;tell this whole story.</p><p>We’d advise Greg to&nbsp;think practically in&nbsp;this case. He&nbsp;wrote that he&nbsp;was unable to&nbsp;give the kids all that special care that they both needed, and he&nbsp;literally was torn between the necessity to&nbsp;provide for them and to&nbsp;care for them. No&nbsp;one offered him help when he&nbsp;was alone with them two, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;sounds reasonable that Greg might want to&nbsp;put them into a&nbsp;special place where their special needs will be&nbsp;satisfied by&nbsp;professionally trained and specially educated people.</p><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;his ex-wife has been so&nbsp;active, we’d advise Greg to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her about all the difficulties that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through, and he&nbsp;might as&nbsp;well show her some videos or&nbsp;photos from his family archive, where he&nbsp;and the kids were trying to&nbsp;interact. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;Maggie was absent from the lives of&nbsp;her children for 9&nbsp;years, she might have no&nbsp;idea about the hard work and the special routine that Greg needed to&nbsp;deal with while he&nbsp;was taking care of&nbsp;the kids.</p><p>We&nbsp;respect Greg’s decision, and we&nbsp;think people shouldn’t judge this dad for choosing to&nbsp;give his kids up&nbsp;for adoption. But we&nbsp;sincerely believe in&nbsp;the happy ending of&nbsp;this story, and we’d love to&nbsp;find out one day that Greg’s kids have found a&nbsp;loving and caring family and live happily in&nbsp;it.</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband had a&nbsp;kid with his <a href=#>ex-wife</a>, and the kid wasn’t even his biological son. But the woman adopted the child anyways, so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;doesn’t end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;orphanage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauecBmqqKml6GybrDAnWSappRitm6%2BxJycp6ycrnqordWeZGtln5t6rsWMpKCdq12bvLN5wJ2mqayZpLtuus6wZJ6ulafGsLrErGSjrZSctq%2BzjKacZnBhbIZ3gI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10754-lucozade-still-have-energy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lucozade still has the energy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-kal-penn-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Kal Penn Make?
