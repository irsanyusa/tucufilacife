That said, it's important to note that the card's 4% back category on gas and EV charging stations applies to all eligible gas stations worldwide and not just gas at Costco.</p><p>There are a few notable exceptions. For example, the fine print for the card says members will only earn 1% back on "gas purchased at superstores, supermarkets, convenience stores and warehouse clubs other than Costco or for fuel used for non-automobile purposes."</p><p>For the most part, these details make the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> ideal for the following types of consumers:</p><ul><li>Heavy Costco shoppers who want to maximize rewards on their purchases.</li><li>Consumers who are okay with redeeming their rewards for Costco merchandise.</li><li>People who commute to work or pay to charge their electric cars on the go.</li><li>Anyone who wants a rewards credit card with no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees.</li></ul><h2 id=costco-membership>Costco membership</h2><p>As we mentioned already, you must be a Costco member to apply for the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> or even use the rewards you earn.

After signing up, cardholders earn cash back at the following rates:</p><ul><li>4% back on up to $7,000 per year in gas purchases worldwide and EV charging stations (then 1% back)</li><li>3% back on restaurant purchases and eligible travel</li><li>2% back on Costco and Costco.com purchases</li><li>1% back on everything else</li></ul><p>With this rewards structure in mind, it's easy to see how you could rack up a ton of cash back on gas purchases, groceries at Costco stores, dining, travel and more. However, you should know about the very unique way the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> doles out rewards before you sign up for this card.</p><p>Instead of letting you rack up cash back you can use throughout the year whenever you're ready, this card only gives you your cash back in the form of a rewards check once per year when your February statement closes. This means you can't save up your cash back to use at your leisure, and that you'll have to wait 12 months to be able to access your rewards haul each year.</p><p>Not only that, but rewards are only redeemable in Costco stores for Costco merchandise. You may be able to use your Costco rewards check to get cash back at a Costco register too, but the fine print on the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> says individual Costco stores can allow this (or not allow it) based on their own discretion.</p><h2 id=additional-hidden-perks>Additional hidden perks</h2><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> doesn't have a lot of other benefits beyond the rewards it offers. In fact, the main listed card perk is the fact you can use your Costco credit card as your ID card to shop in stores.</p><p>The other major cardholder perk you get with the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> is no foreign transaction fees. This benefit can be helpful if you travel internationally often and you don't want to pay extra fees to use your credit card when you do.</p><h2 id=what-could-be-improved>What could be improved?</h2><p>While the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> has an excellent rewards rate by any measure, there are a few notable downsides to be aware of. Improvements that could dramatically improve the value of this card include the following:</p><ul><li>The card doesn't have a sign-up bonus. Other cash back credit cards offer generous rewards plus a cash bonus of $200 or more, yet the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> doesn't have a welcome offer of any kind.</li><li>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Costco Anywhere Visa(R) Card by Citi" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006104*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> lacks an introductory APR offer. This card comes with a high interest rate that applies when you carry a balance, and the same APR applies to balance transfers.</li><li>The earning rate for Costco purchases and other spending could be higher. Earning 2% back at Costco is just okay since other cards offer 2% cash back on everything you buy, and the 1% rewards rate on other purchases is seriously lacking.</li></ul><h2 id=how-does-the-it-compare>How does the it compare?</h2><p>With the downsides of this card at the top of your mind, you may be wondering how other cash back credit cards compare.
