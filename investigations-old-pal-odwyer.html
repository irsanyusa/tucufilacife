So many firemen, cops, politicos and Old Pals dealt in skulduggery during his years as mayor of New York that O’Dwyer is continually being asked embarrassing questions about his relations with them. Last week the Kefauver committee reversed the process, called in Old Pal Irving Sherman and asked him why he had been so chummy with the mayor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shirts off. Sherman is a big, tanned, affable promoter who has also maintained palship with several big U.S. hoodlums and has been accused of acting as a link between underworld big shots, politicians and businessmen. (Although never convicted, J. Edgar Hoover once called him “one of the most prominent [U.S.] criminals.”) Last week, however, Sherman remained unabashed by these hard names. He described himself as a simple businessman, and spoke of O’Dwyer as an ingrate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sherman told the committee that he knew O’Dwyer when the ambassador was a major in the Army Air Forces, decided he was “a real nice man” and resolved to help his political career. On 15 occasions, O’Dwyer and Sherman registered together at a Washington hotel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sherman tried to get pro-Communist Congressman Vito Marcantonio to back his new friend. The three of them, he recounted, once met at the Maryland farm of one Julius Lulley, proprietor of Harvey’s Restaurant in Washington. “Lulley had a bar,” Sherman recalled sentimentally, “and we sat around [it] a bit and then . . . O’Dwyer and Marcantonio went out into the garden . . . and took their shirts off and even got to singing together . . .” The duet did not become political. “While the Little Flower [Fiorello LaGuardia] lives, I will be for him and with him. If he don’t [run], then you and I can get together,” Marcantonio told O’Dwyer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Heat On. When O’Dwyer ran for mayor in 1945, Sherman raised about $6,000 for the campaign. A few weeks before election day, a detective sidled up and said: “The general would like you to leave town, and he would like you to leave immediately.” Sherman said the detective told him of an impending “terrible blast” (about O’Dwyer’s 1942 meeting with Gambler Frank Costello, which Sherman attended) in the newspapers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sherman skipped. But when he returned to New York, he told the committee with a prodigious sigh, O’Dwyer refused to see him. Once they met at a policeman’s funeral on the steps of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. They shook hands warmly. When they parted, one of Sherman’s detective friends came up to him and said: “What are you so friendly with that guy for? He’s tapping your telephone.” Sherman could hardly believe it. “We’re not friendly now, Senator,” he told the committee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sherman’s tale seemed calculated to please almost everybody: it gave O’Dwyer’s critics a chance to fire a few more shots; it gave O’Dwyer’s friends a chance to cry that he was a dove who had attacked at least one of the blackbirds who had insisted on flying formation on him, and gave the committee a chance to check off a bit of unfinished business. Sherman, in the role of cast-off friend, seemed pleased, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tam9laYFwtc2vnKysmZyutbXOp6pmp5yZerGty2amna%2Bpmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./transition-energetique-lademe-imagine-notre-vie-quotidienne-en-2030-et-en-2050.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>l'Ademe imagine notre vie quotidienne en 2030 et en 2050</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-bobby-darin-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Bobby Darin Make?
