It declared that it <a href=#>could not provide</a> the world with the actual results of the vote given that Venezuela has been subjected to a “foreign terrorist cyber-attack.” Yet somehow it conclusively and “irrevocably” declared the autocratic Nicolás Maduro as the winner with <a href=#>51.2%</a> of the vote over opposition candidate <a href=#>Edmundo González Urrutia’s</a> 44.2%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The opposition was ready to prevent a <a href=#>stolen election</a>. Beyond accusing the government of committing a massive fraud, it announced that it had gathered <a href=#>73.2%</a> of the receipts printed by Venezuela’s electronic voting machines. They took photos of each one of these tally sheets—compiled by their supporters at most of the country’s polling stations—and published them on a<a href=#> website</a> launched a day after the vote. By its calculations, González won with a stunning two-thirds majority.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As tensions boil over in Venezuela, control of the narrative and the moral high ground over the past week has been essential. While the opposition makes its case to the country and the world that it was robbed of a landslide victory, the government is arguing that its own triumph has been obfuscated by a U.S.-led “<a href=#>fascist</a>” coalition. The latter is a case that no one should take seriously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/venezuela-protests-election-votes.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venezuela’s democracy has long been in crisis. What began as a broadly popular political movement under the <a href=#>socialist President Hugo Chávez</a> in 1999 gradually slid into autocracy. Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy was unable to keep up with the generous social programs that made Chavismo popular, especially after the <a href=#>2007 expropriations of foreign oil companies</a> spooked them into leaving. A major oil price slump in 2014 caused the petrostate’s economy to <a href=#>go into freefall</a> and Maduro, who <a href=#>took office in 2013</a>, increasingly shifted from redistribution to repression to hold on to power.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The opposition was under <a href=#>no illusions</a> that this election would be free or fair. But they formed a coalition of anti-Chavista parties called the Democratic Unitary Platform and ran a campaign that expressed trust that the ballot box would vindicate them—while planning for the worst.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following outrage over the official result, the Maduro government has doubled down on the baseless claim that Venezuelan democracy is under siege by shadowy foreign interventionists. (Memories of a <a href=#>U.S.-linked coup</a> attempt in 2002 and outrage over ongoing U.S. sanctions remain a potent motivator among Chavistas.) The government has also cracked down on protests, with dozens killed and thousands arrested in the past week. Footage of <a href=#>opposition leaders being detained</a><strong> </strong>by security forces has also proliferated online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/venezuela-protests-election-protestor.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How will this all unfold?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maduro seems keen to be seen going through the motions of the democratic process—such as handing over an official complaint to the government-controlled courts to weigh in on the election result. But he has a habit of overplaying his hand. During the campaign, his government banned María Corina Machado, the opposition’s first candidate, from running. This made her a political martyr and further consolidated the movement against his regime. Efforts to interrupt opposition campaign events or close the border to prevent the Venezuelan diaspora—which at 7.7 million is the region’s largest exodus ever—from coming back to vote only backfired.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maduro is also taking steps to prevent his security forces from defecting. This seems unlikely thanks to the <a href=#>deep embedding of intelligence forces from Cuba</a>, Venezuela’s closest international ally, within the military. Yet videos circulating on <a href=#>social media suggest</a> that some police and military units may already be disobeying orders to repress the mass protests across the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/venezuela-protests-election-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The opposition continues to ask Venezuelans to keep calm, and their preparation for a stolen vote is producing results. The U.S. has come out in support of González, calling him the election winner. The E.U., for its part, says it does not recognize Maduro’s win and is <a href=#>demanding independent verification</a>. Even <a href=#>friendlier Latin American governments</a> like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico are pressuring him to set the record straight. Venezuela has powerful international allies like Russia and China but Maduro looks increasingly alone. An emboldened Machado and González have also come out of hiding, after officials called for their arrest, to <a href=#>hold a massive protest</a> in Caracas. The country’s top prosecutor has announced <a href=#>a criminal probe</a> after they called on the army to abandon their support for Maduro, but the two seem undeterred.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The upshot in Venezuela remains uncertain. But the momentous past few days have been a long time in the making.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBshnqEjq%2Bcp52qqrKtrYymmJ2toqR6qLvNs5ilnapisq2xwq2gqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-student-who-faced-hardships-in-school-for-her-ginger-hair-becomes-miss-england-and-wants-to-empower-kids-going-through-the-same-thing-809622.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Lady Who Faced Hardships for Her Ginger Locks Has Become the First Redhead to Be Crowned Miss Engl</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-witch-cinematographer-jarin-blaschke-natural-light-1201716424.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Witch Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke on the Films Natural-Light Gloom</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
