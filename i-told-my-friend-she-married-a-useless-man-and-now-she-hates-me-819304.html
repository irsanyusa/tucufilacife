That’s precisely the dilemma faced by&nbsp;this Reddit user. She turned to&nbsp;the vast online community for guidance, wondering if&nbsp;she’s handling the situation with her friend the right way.</p><h2>This is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>her story</a> and the situation she’s facing:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/435/089/c257485f0ba196f413bdbb6819.jpg><p>I&nbsp;(32F) am&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother of&nbsp;two <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> (6M&nbsp;and 5F). &lt;<a href=# title=strong data-link=tag>strong</a>>I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;single mother by&nbsp;choice (my&nbsp;kids are donor conceived).</p><p>I&nbsp;am lucky enough to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;French teacher in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private school, and a&nbsp;paid-off house from my&nbsp;parents’ life insurance and inheritance.</p><p>Before I&nbsp;had either of&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids, <strong>I&nbsp;made sure to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;year’s worth of&nbsp;living expenses</strong>.

She, on&nbsp;the other hand, doesn’t even have a&nbsp;couple hundred dollars in&nbsp;her savings account, let alone a&nbsp;year’s worth of&nbsp;living expenses.</p><p>I&nbsp;usually ignore her comments or&nbsp;brush them off because&nbsp;I understand the stress she is&nbsp;under.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb2/94c/14819c54f5accdea4d09f6eab5.jpg><p><strong>About ten days ago</strong>, she started hinting that she couldn’t afford daycare, and any mention of&nbsp;her husband taking care of&nbsp;their child was dismissed.

You’re exactly right that it’s not your problem that she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;this situation. While a&nbsp;heavy dose of&nbsp;<a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a> is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;your friendship, her having a&nbsp;husband who isn’t employed and cannot contribute to&nbsp;the childcare she needs is&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem she needs to&nbsp;solve.<br>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;annoying and impractical for her to&nbsp;think the answer here is&nbsp;for you to&nbsp;provide childcare. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;dismissive of&nbsp;the fact that you are already busy and only have about seven months remaining of&nbsp;the time you’ve allowed yourself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;hiatus, so&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;short-term solution. It’s too bad that she’s letting her situation cloud her judgment. You are not heartless, and that was an&nbsp;unfair response from her and inappropriate behavior throughout this interaction. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>owls_and_cardinals&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Unless the husband is&nbsp;bedridden or&nbsp;otherwise physically incapable of&nbsp;working or&nbsp;providing childcare, he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;take responsibility and step up&nbsp;to&nbsp;parent his own child. If&nbsp;she isn’t going to&nbsp;make him, she needs to&nbsp;leave him and file for child support. While this might not provide much if&nbsp;he’s unwilling to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;job, it&nbsp;will at&nbsp;least mean one less mouth to&nbsp;feed. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>crazycatchemist1&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/79a/448/bac7c357e39363a3ef14cd2ac1.jpg><ul><li>We&nbsp;have all been unemployed at&nbsp;some point or&nbsp;struggled for money, I&nbsp;get that. What I&nbsp;don’t get is&nbsp;how her husband has been unemployed for almost four years. Even if&nbsp;it’s burger flipping or&nbsp;Doordashing until something better comes along, he&nbsp;could have figured something out. And on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, he’s “not good with kids”? She had a&nbsp;baby with someone who isn’t good with kids?<br>Maybe it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little harsh to&nbsp;call her husband useless, but he&nbsp;is, in&nbsp;fact, useless if&nbsp;he&nbsp;isn’t capable of&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;his own baby while his wife works. He&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;pick a&nbsp;struggle.<br>She’s mad you’re not helping her, and I’m willing to&nbsp;bet she’s mad because you made her realize that having a&nbsp;baby with this useless man was a&nbsp;mistake on&nbsp;her part. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Atlas-Rising-Up&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>You may have expressed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;slightly harsh way, but you’re not wrong. Her husband hasn’t worked for several years. They had a&nbsp;baby together, and yet he&nbsp;can’t actually do&nbsp;anything useful to&nbsp;help care for the baby. She has, indeed, married a&nbsp;completely useless man.<br>The norm should be&nbsp;that if&nbsp;one parent works, the other parent takes primary care of&nbsp;the kids. If&nbsp;both parents work, hopefully they make enough to&nbsp;afford daycare. Her crappy husband is&nbsp;not your problem. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>_mmiggs_&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>What do&nbsp;you think you would do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;the user’s situation?
