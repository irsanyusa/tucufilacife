The police station was broken into. One of the most popular fast foods, Greg's, was broken into. A bank, NatWest, was damaged. Police were attacked.</p><p>"Over my own house, a police helicopter was hovering for over five hours. It started around six in the evening and things didn't come back to normal until 1 in the middle of the night," he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He said the far-right extremists targeted black Muslim migrants because of the misinformation about the identity of the arrested suspect, even though Police had revealed the suspect was a British black Christian teenager.</p><p>He revealed that a friend of his, who is a Christian residing in Middlesborough, had his home attacked by the rioters.</p><p>"I have a friend in Middlesborough, whose house was stoned and his windows broken. He is Nigerian and he is Christian. The fact is that they said they are protesting the increase in the crime rate of Muslim immigrants because they felt that it was a black Muslim immigrant that killed these three little girls, but the police have come out to say it's actually a British black Christian," he added.</p><p>However, the situation is different for Janet, another Nigerian whose house is on the street where the first protest occurred.</p><p>"I wasn’t around when it happened. I had to leave before it started because it started in my street, and I didn’t return until everything died down," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Janet said she fled home before the initial protest got underway after words got around that it could snowball into chaos.</p><p>"It was a planned ‘peaceful’ protest. The information was spread all over that there will be one. The meeting point was a park like a stone's throw from my house.</p><p>"Taxi drivers that knew how the far-right extremists can be already told people of colour to stay at home or avoid the areas as much as possible," she stated.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6056103b-0094-467e-ac2f-9da1dbd3d2b9 data-caption="Helicopter hovered over my home for 5 hours - Nigerians tell UK riots experience [NYT]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/iInktkpTURBXy9lYTJmODgxMWJjNGJiNDYxYmZkNjYzMjdlYTBhODc0OS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAb3Cww></span><p>Janet's experience is similar to that of <strong>Mayor</strong>, a Liverpool resident who was also out of town when the riots erupted.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I didn't experience it in person because I wasn't in the city when it happened. I just got back and things are calm now," he said.</p><p>Manchester resident, <strong>Yemi</strong>,<strong> </strong>said his area wasn't affected by the riots but noted all black people and Muslims were being cautious of their movement because of the heightened tension.</p><p>"Nothing really happened at my end but one needs to be very careful of their movement. It's advisable that people go out in groups and avoid some places due to how volatile they can be.</p><p>“The riots were largely peaceful in Manchester but places like Piccadilly should be avoided until the matter dials down," he said.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ada9211f-102c-4ce2-8a6e-75204da6ec41 data-caption="An illustrative photo of Nigerians in the UK staging a solidarity march to protest the killings in Nigeria.
