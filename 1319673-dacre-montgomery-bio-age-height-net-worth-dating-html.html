This woman right here is the backbone of everything I do. Sheâ€™s the brains AND the elegance. Sheâ€™s the one that packs up her bags and moves around the world for me. Sheâ€™s the one that wakes up in a different hotel room everyday, because sheâ€™s there supporting me. Sheâ€™s the one that has to deal with me coming home (exhausted) acting like an absolute basket case. Sheâ€™s the one that helps me flesh out every idea. Sheâ€™s the sounding board and the intelligence. Sheâ€™s the emotional support and also the person that allows me to live in the present and not take some things too seriously. So hereâ€™s a massive thank you to partners all around the world. The people that (sometimes) donâ€™t get the recognition for just how much they do.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04f932bd8f1b8998.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about the fabulous Ezra Miller</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eaad6e712ff809d0.jpg><h2>Dacre Montgomery net worth</h2><p class=align-left>According to wealthygorilla.com, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his net worth</a> is $1 million</p><h2>Social media</h2><p class=align-left>Dacre Montgomery Instagram account has 6.5 million followers.

But I was never a reckless kid.</li><li>I was really fat in school.</li><li>My mum didn't really let me watch TV until I was about 5 years old.</li><li>I didn't have any friends. I was bullied. I didn't play sports.</li><li>I have so much drive and passion for this industry and the creative arts, and I want other kids to have that kind of drive, and to have a fire in their belly for whatever industry that they want to get into.</li><li>I was bullied in high school, and it's interesting coming from the other side of the camera lens, finding out that all of these people that I thought were my antagonists in my life were probably just as insecure as I was at that age.</li><li>I wasn't a good kid in school. I wasn't a bad kid. I just didn't focus. My grades weren't good. I mucked around, you know, a phase everyone went through.</li><li>After Year 12, I went to Vancouver for my gap year and met an agent who told me to lose 25 kg.</li><li>My parents worked in the film industry, but they both worked behind the camera, so I like to think that I have a really good understanding of how all the parts of the puzzle come together to make a film or TV show.</li><li>I came from drama school, and it's a group of 18 people working together in every single production and splitting up the roles for three years, so I am very much about the team.</li><li>It's not just the actor in front of the camera. And it's important to have respect for all those people that work behind the camera.</li><li>It's one huge arc right until you're in your early 20s. You're always changing and always learning, but it's very much that chapter in your life: fall crazy in love, become extremely angry at little things. It's a tumultuous time.</li><li>I am the biggest geek and fan of film and TV, and I just go through phases.</li><li>It'd been about four months since shooting 'Power Rangers,' and 'Stranger Things' was the first thing I saw that made me think, 'I need this.' I had one day to get my act together, so I made a short film rather than a self-tape. It had an opening score, opening titles, and I may or may not have put on a g-string and danced to 'Hungry Like a Wolf'.</li><li>It sounds super cliche, but my sister is 12 years younger than me, and I remember when I was there holding her in my arms for the first time. And that kind of responsibility you feel when you hold a child in your arms.</li><li>I have a confession... I don't eat Vegemite, which probably makes me "un-Australian".</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d7566a39425b6997.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Facts about Aaron Phypers, Denise Richards current husband</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/842dc14a13d457e6.jpg><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><p class=align-left>Here are more interesting facts about the actor:</p><h3>1.
