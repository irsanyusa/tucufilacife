It debuted at the SXSW Film Festival&nbsp;where people got to see a very vulnerable side of the singer. She opens up about experiencing rape and sexual assault</strong> <strong>which she has never spoken about publicly before.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-lovato-speaks-about-losing-her-virginity-to-rape-as-a-teen>Demi Lovato Speaks About Losing Her Virginity To Rape As A Teen</h2><p>Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil first opens up with a warning. “This documentary contains raw and honest discussions about addiction, eating disorders, sexual abuse and mental health. It may be triggering for some” it says. During the documentary, Demi speaks very candidly about being raped during her Disney days.</p><p>“When I was a teenager…I lost my virginity in a rape,” she says. “I called that person back a month later and tried to make it right by being in control and all it did was make me feel worse.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DEMI LOVATO EXPLAINS WHY SHE’S REVEALING HER DARKEST SECRETS TO THE WORLD</a></strong></p><p>“My #MeToo story is me telling somebody that someone did this to me, and they never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in. There’s the tea” she adds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-implies-that-the-rape-happened-during-her-disney-days>Demi Implies That The Rape Happened During Her Disney Days</h3><p>As she talks about this experience in the documentary, clips from her days on Disney Channel working on Sonny With A Chance and Camp Rock play. This leads the audience to assume that the rape happened while she was working on one of these projects.</p><p>“I really beat myself up for years — which is also why I had a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that it was a rape when it happened,” Demi says. “We were hooking up but I said — hey, this is not going any farther, I’m a virgin, and I don’t want to lose it this way. And that didn’t matter to them, they did it anyways. And I internalized it and I told myself it was my fault because I still went in the room with him. I still hooked up with him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Demi was one of the Disney stars that publicly declared they were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting to have sex until marriage.</a> She wore a purity ring as did the Jonas Brothers who she got to work with throughout the Camp Rock franchise. After being raped, Demi’s bulimia got so bad that she began throwing up blood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-reveals-she-was-sexual-assaulted-on-the-night-of-her-overdose>Demi Reveals She Was Sexual Assaulted On The Night Of Her Overdose</h3><p>In 2018, Demi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered a drug overdose</a> that left her fighting for her life. On the night of the overdose, she claims that she was sexually assaulted by her drug dealer. “I didn’t just overdose. I was taken advantage of,” she says. “When they found me, I was naked and I was blue. I was literally left for dead after he took advantage of me.” &nbsp;</p><p>But that was not the last interaction Demi had with that man. She invited him over her house a few months later. “I wanted to rewrite his choice of violating me,” she explains. “I wanted it to be my choice. I said, ‘No, I’m going to f*** you.’ It didn’t fix anything or take anything away — it just made me feel worse. It brought me back to my knees and begging God for help.”</p><p>The former ‘X Factor’ judge also speaks in the documentary about how she uses weed and alcohol in moderation now. This comes along with her announcement that she will be coming out with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first album since 2017</a> called Dancing With the Devil…The Art of Starting Over.&nbsp;The album will be out on April 2.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH DEMI LOVATO SHARE THE TRUTH ABOUT 2018 OVERDOSE THAT NEARLY KILLED HER</a></strong></p><p>You can catch Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil on YouTube on March 23.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sharon-Osbourne-The-Talk-co-hosts.jpeg alt="Sharon Osbourne Calls Racism Claims Against Her To Be ‘An Absolute Lie…’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>demi lovato</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56komWcpMOiwM5mmpqmlJ6xrcWMqKeepqNiwrF5wJumrqxdp66xsYyapZ1lo5rFtq3LZpisq5GqubV5yKdkp52nYrGwr9SmnKeskafGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1259662-funny-pokemon-pick-lines-jokes-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Funny Pokemon pick up lines and jokes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./volet-recettes-du-plf-2024-les-senateurs-peaufinent-les-contours-de-france-ruralites-revitalisation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Volet recettes du PLF 2024 Les snateurs peaufinent les contours de France Ruralits Revitalis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
