The ultimate playtime powerhouse for babies? Baby play mats and gyms! These engaging spaces provide a comfy place for tummy time, playtime, and sensory exploration during those precious first months.</p><p>Learning specialist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rebecca Mannis</a>, PhD, says that “play mats and activity mats are examples of handy tools that engage kids and let parents bond with their children using safe, colorful, and sensory-rich items.” They help kids feel comfortable moving and starting to develop a sense of cause-effect. “Building language and strong relationships with their parents starts with infancy and enriching experiences with the world and people around them,” she adds. But with a vast array of options available, choosing the perfect one can feel overwhelming.</p><p>Our guide to the best baby mats and gyms shares expert insights, navigates the features and benefits, and offers things to consider when selecting the best play mat and gym for your little one.

There are many zones that promote different milestones and sensory experiences. “Mostly, it's perfect for ages 0 -12 months, and has plenty of stimulating activities that engage and encourage the growth of your baby's developmental stages.

She adds, “Play mats can be used well into the toddler years.”</p><p>An activity gym usually consists of a round play mat with arches made of wood or foam with sensory toys, mirrors, and other developmental tools attached to keep your baby's attention. “Babies usually outgrow these by the time they are 12 months old, but the mat can be repurposed as a small play area once the arches are removed,” Furman notes.</p><p>The main difference is the size and stage of each. “Play mats can grow with your baby as they get older while activity gyms are wonderful for encouraging sensory development for babies 0 - 12 months old," she explains.</p><h3>Are baby activity mats worth it?</h3><p>“If compared to hardwood or tile flooring, it is a safer landing. Carpets can also serve this purpose,” Dr. Berger says. The activities and elements on the mat can be good for promoting child developmental skills, he notes. “But it should not be used as a ‘babysitter’— the baby should still be supervised as they may roll, crawl, or meander off of the mat,” he advises.</p><p>Furman says baby mats are worth the purchase, especially as some come in larger sizes for walkers and crawlers and provide additional cushioning if they fall and need more support. “There are so many stylish options that come in modern, decor-friendly designs that many parents often leave as floor coverings in the main play areas for many years after the baby phase is over,” she says. “Smaller size mats can be transported to serve as picnic and beach blankets and fold up small for easy transport.”</p><h3>When should I start using a play gym?</h3><p>Dr. Berger says play mats can be used as early as the first couple weeks of life. “We want to promote tummy time from a very early age, and a safe play mat is an ideal surface for this,” he says.</p><p>Furman says that a play gym with multiple attachments can be used from 0 - 12 weeks and provides sensory stimulation for your baby, including graphic black and white cards, mirrors, and toys that allow them to enhance tummy time play. “The toys and accessories are often stage-based and can be interchanged to encourage cognitive and motor development,” she explains. “The gyms also offer accessories on the mat, so when your baby is engaged in tummy time play, they can develop their core, motor tone, vision, and grasping abilities while enjoying different toys,” she adds. In addition, activity gyms help prevent flat head syndrome since they encourage tummy time play and frequent shifting and tilting of baby's head as they view items overhead, Furman notes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkpavunnPpZiyZZ2WwbR5wKebZp%2BposBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./middle-income-consumer-shopping-behaviors-and-attitudes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Data Dive into Middle Income Consumers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./le-gouvernement-consulte-les-francais-sur-lutilisation-de-leurs-impots.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Le gouvernement consulte les Franais sur l'utilisation de leurs impts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
