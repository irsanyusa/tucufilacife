And the main person who influenced his personality and career was his mother&nbsp;— Pattie Mallette. Their relationship wasn’t perfect, they were not always sweet to&nbsp;each other, but they can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great example of&nbsp;hope, will, and strength.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were inspired by&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;Justin’s Bieber success, which is&nbsp;closely connected to&nbsp;his mom, and we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with you.</p><p><h2>His mom’s childhood was tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eff/45a/c6bf875568b7105e8cf241b3fa.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;no&nbsp;secret and Pattie Mallette doesn’t hide the fact that her life wasn’t easy. In&nbsp;her book <a href=#>Nowhere But&nbsp;Up</a>, <strong>she describes how cruel the world was to&nbsp;her until the age of&nbsp;15</strong>. She had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bad people around her, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;even felt normal. After so&nbsp;many years in&nbsp;this mess, she became quite a&nbsp;rebel teenager and even <a href=#>vandalized</a> school property.</p><p>She met Jeremy Bieber when she was 15&nbsp;and their relationship started. Soon, she left her parent’s home and feelings of&nbsp;loneliness and depression overcame her. But one year changed everything. Something happened in&nbsp;her head and she <strong>got the faith and courage to&nbsp;transform her life</strong>. She was only 17&nbsp;at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4c/e5b/e4c3f15b8681780417ac3d5cd1.jpg><p>Pattie got pregnant and, in&nbsp;1994, she gave birth to&nbsp;her son <a href=#>Justin</a>. When he&nbsp;was just 2&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;show his interest in&nbsp;music. Like a&nbsp;real mother, Mallette noticed it&nbsp;and<strong> did everything to&nbsp;encourage her son’s <a href=# title=talent data-link=tag>talent</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/505/16c/c06ce3524c869ce8d2084bd783.jpg><p>Pattie lived with Justin alone because she split up&nbsp;with her boyfriend Jeremy Bieber. In&nbsp;the documentary <a href=#>Never Say Never</a>, she opened up&nbsp;saying that it&nbsp;was obvious for her that <strong>her son needed stability and that she found that strength somewhere</strong>. It&nbsp;was challenging because Pattie was a&nbsp;teenager and she was alone. While her friends were going out and having fun, she was at&nbsp;home being a&nbsp;mother.</p><p><h2>Justin and his mom stopped talking to&nbsp;each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/024/1a2/16794d530888395d703c969bde.jpg><p>Justin became very popular at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>confessed</a> later, saying, “I&nbsp;was letting fame destroy&nbsp;me.” He&nbsp;broke the law several times and his first <a href=#>arrest</a> was in&nbsp;2014. More than 270,000 people petitioned to&nbsp;have him deported from the United States and Bieber became distant from his mother.</p><p>He&nbsp;realized that his relationship with Pattie became “<a href=#>pretty <span><span>nonexistent.</span></span></a>” <strong>Justin was ashamed, because he&nbsp;didn’t want his mom to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disappointed </strong>in&nbsp;him and he&nbsp;knew she was."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0d/613/687e215ef093e7911be673b27c.jpg><p>Pattie moved to&nbsp;Hawaii. The distance between her and Justin got even bigger. Bieber felt guilty for losing their connection and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his hands to&nbsp;fix&nbsp;it. During his concert in&nbsp;2016&nbsp;<strong>he shouted, “<a href=#>Aloha, Pattie!</a>” and publicly said that he&nbsp;loves his mom.</strong></p><p>Pattie’s reaction was immediate. She wrote on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>: “Yes @justinbieber was a&nbsp;good boy and called to&nbsp;wish me&nbsp;Happy Mother’s Day!” And there was also another <a href=#>tweet</a> that was full of&nbsp;excitement: “Awwwwe!!! Thanks @justinbieber I&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> you so&nbsp;much, that was so&nbsp;sweet! ALOHA EVERYONE! XOXO.”</p><p><h2>Wild days are over.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/641/56b/245bdc5bebbadd3cfbb62b653e.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took time for their relationship to&nbsp;recover, but in&nbsp;2018 Pattie finally published a&nbsp;sweet <a href=#>post</a> on&nbsp;Instagram dedicated to&nbsp;her son: “<strong>Please <a href=# title=forgive data-link=tag>forgive</a> me&nbsp;of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;shortcomings as&nbsp;I forgive you of&nbsp;yours, past, present, and future</strong>!! Bless you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;all you were created to&nbsp;be. What an&nbsp;honor it’s been to&nbsp;know you and watch you grow as&nbsp;your mother. We&nbsp;got this. #LoveWins.”</p><p>And love won. Pattie <a href=#>writes</a> that she is&nbsp;very “proud of&nbsp;the amazing young man” he&nbsp;is, and the young man he&nbsp;is&nbsp;becoming. She understands that no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;perfect, but she admires his character and integrity.</p><p>We&nbsp;are very happy for them and hope they continue to&nbsp;preserve this balance and harmony!</p><p>When did you say thank you to&nbsp;your parent last time? Do&nbsp;you believe that love can conquer all misunderstandings?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2v9OipWaamZqvpr6MqaytZZFiubDAjKidZp2Wm7yzwIyfpqtloprCr7XOp2SwoaSdeqm10makqKVdrLWwedKeo5%2BklajArcWMq5iiq5WZeqm1zGZucm9gZ4Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./relance-letat-et-les-metropoles-enterinent-leur-accord-de-methode.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>l'Etat et les mtropoles entrinent leur accord de mthode</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-joanna-garcia-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does JoAnna Garcia Make?
