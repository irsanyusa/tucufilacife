We set the strategy, the roadmap, the headcount, the resourcing. Answers are a fundamental part of the job. Or at least that‚Äôs the common misperception in leading teams. We <i>think</i> we need to have answers. This is especially true with artificial intelligence (AI), when the buzz is palpable and our teams are clamoring to understand ‚Äúwhat does this mean for me?‚Äù</p><p>So it‚Äôs no surprise to us that while a recent <a href=#>Slack Workforce Index</a> shows that the share of leaders looking to incorpora te AI tools into their business has grown 7x since Sept. 2023, over two-thirds of workers have never used AI at work.</p><p>We are all searching for answers: <i>What tool should I use? How should I use it in my job? Is it safe and secure? What other considerations or guardrails should I place?</i></p><p>The two of us have led teams across research, analytics, product, and strategy whose jobs are to chart a path through ambiguity. But if there‚Äôs one thing that we‚Äôve learned in our careers, it‚Äôs this: when we are so early in this journey of figuring out AI at work, the best path forward is to create a culture of experimentation rather than have specific answers.</p><p>We have to empower our teams to think like researchers. To realize the full potential of AI, companies need to create a safe space to experiment with AI and empower workers to participate in shaping how AI can be applied to their specific jobs.</p><p>Here are five ways leaders can start to create a culture of experimentation with AI:</p><p><b>1. Put in the work to make AI work.</b></p><p>Only 15% of workers globally strongly agree they have the education and training necessary to use AI effectively. It‚Äôs important to provide guidance on how to get started and to carve out time and space to experiment and evolve how AI might be used in their daily tasks.</p><p>Across both Slack and <a href=#>Women Defining AI</a>, we have run a lightweight experiment where we provide 10 to 15 minutes of structured education daily for three weeks. Participants are then given a short, hands-on project where they can apply what they‚Äôve learned. More than anything, it allows people to try using AI in an approachable way and build intuition in different applications, whether it‚Äôs in their personal life or at work.</p><p>üí° <i>Expert tip: Incorporate quick sprints of weekly training sessions (they can be as little as 10 minutes) that allow employees to get their hands on AI and get used to using it.</i></p><p><b>2. Build comfort with ‚Äúthis didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù</b></p><p>Fostering a culture of AI experimentation means creating an environment where employees can explore, innovate, and learn without fear of failure or retribution. Workers who feel trusted by their employers are 94% more likely to have tried AI for work-related tasks. Key to integrating AI in everyday work is giving employees the freedom to take risks, providing them with the resources they need like AI usage guidelines, and making sure they have the time to really be creative in their ideas.</p><p>In a <a href=#>recent guide to AI in the workplace</a>, Charter described how Coursera CEO Jeff Maggioncalda embraces vulnerability and shares the AI prompts he is testing with employees. The prompts don‚Äôt always work as expected, but his approach inspires employee trial-and-error.</p><p>Our favorite Women Defining AI examples are when members take projects to unexpected places, like one who used AI to not only create a new Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) character but also an entire play script to use in her D&D meetups. Another member uploaded custom information about her style guidelines and preferences to create a custom AI bot that suggests and assesses work outfits for her day.</p><p>It‚Äôs through these more creative use cases that our teams create <i>novel</i> approaches where AI can be useful, demonstrating how much brainstorming or ideating AI <i>can</i> really tackle (as in the D&D example) or how much you can personalize an AI‚Äôs responses with a simple file or two (as in the work outfits example).</p><p>üí° <i>Expert tip: Host frequent workshops or forums to create spaces for your team to exchange ideas and test AI experiments with colleagues. Share both the ideas that worked and those that didn‚Äôt work and discuss why.</i></p><p><b>3. Embrace incremental change and start small.</b></p><p>If AI is going to completely transform work, it isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight. Such change also feels out of reach for many employees. Instead, start small. Chip away. AI can transform your job, little by little.</p><p>At Women Defining AI, we often see that the easiest way to start is to identify ‚Äúone thing you do frequently at work or in your life‚Äù and then experiment with different AI tools to get that task done.</p><p>üí° <i>Expert tip: Be specific and start with experiments with simple use cases within a small team. When you get specific, it‚Äôs easier to know what to experiment with and you can assess whether AI is actually helpful with this task. The goal is to then repeat this process over several core tasks in your workflows. Over time, you will build an intuition about the ‚Äò</i><a href=#><i>aha use cases</i></a><i>‚Äô where AI can help make each task more efficient and, more important, unlock completely new ways of approaching them.</i></p><p><b><strong>Read the rest of this column on </strong></b><a href=#><b><strong>Charter‚Äôs website</strong></b></a><b><strong> for two more tips.<br></strong></b></p><p><strong>Sign up for <a href=#>Charter‚Äôs free newsletter about work and leadership</a>, including how to best navigate AI.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacoJGnwaa%2BjnBnaW1ha4NwtM6wZK2nXZfCqrjDZphmm6Whwba%2BxGamn2WRnnqmxM%2BeqaKllaPBosDIqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./le-parc-dhebergement-sera-maintenu-200000-places-jusquen-mars-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Le parc d'hbergement sera maintenu 200.000 places jusqu'en mars 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leftovers-season-2-finale-damon-lindelof-cavewoman-scene-1201649945.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Damon Lindelof on Leftovers Season 2 Finale, That Wild Cavewoman Opener, Twitter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
