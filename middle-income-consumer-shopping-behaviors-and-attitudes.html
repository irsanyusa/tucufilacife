Morning Consult’s economists have covered <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>sentiment trends</a> in depth. One critical trend: consumer sentiment is rising for high earners, or those in households making at least $100,000 annually. Meanwhile, those in the middle, earning between $50,000 and $100,000 annually, increasingly look like lower income shoppers in terms of consumer sentiment and price sensitivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With that context, it’s high time we take a deeper look at the murky middle, a cohort that shape shifts, mirroring their higher or lower income peers in different contexts. Of course, they often just split the difference.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Middle-income consumer demographics reflect life stage, marital status and educational attainment</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The demographic profile of middle-income Americans sheds light on the individuals in the murky middle. On some variables like gender, they do fall right between their high- and low-income counterparts at a near 50-50 split. Their age range breaks that trend, where middle-income consumers are more likely to fall into the baby boomer generation, given that baby boomers are likely to be retired and bring in less than they were in their earning years.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Family status and income are directly related, given that those in married couples naturally have a higher combined household income than those who are single. Similarly, educational attainment has a direct relationship with income, as income increases for those with advanced degrees.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>High frequency online shopping cuts across income cohorts</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Shopping online at least daily is a…unique behavioral cohort that stretches across all income groups. Fairly even shares of consumers in each economic group report shopping via mobile apps, using Amazon Prime and making purchases on social media several times a day. This data captures purchase volume, not dollar amount, so it’s a reflection of those who frequently enjoy the convenience of online shopping.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">More differentiation appears at the more common weekly and monthly shopping cadences. For Amazon Prime usage in particular, middle-income shoppers look more similar to those in high-income households. Conversely Walmart+ usage is much more evenly distributed across income groups, at a slightly lower annual cost than Amazon Prime ($98 versus $139). That $41 is likely just enough to price out the low income group.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and Peacock unify consumers across income brackets</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">YouTube and Facebook are used so universally that there’s no meaningful differentiation among their users by income level. Other social platforms see users scale up with income. High-income consumers use LinkedIn at much higher rates, given the emphasis on white collar professionals. Yelp connects users to restaurant reviews, so it makes sense that high income users who dine out more often also use the platform at higher rates. TikTok is the lone social app platform where low-income users over index.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Media platforms that offer free content, like Peacock, Roku and Pandora, see less differentiation across income brackets. Middle-income viewers still pay up for the most popular content platforms, including Netflix, Hulu and Disney+, though high earners lead the way across all paid subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The psychographic profile of middle-income consumers mirrors their high-income peers, but their consumption differs</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When asked about their outlook for the future, 86% of middle-income consumers say that planning for the future is very important to them, exceeding the share of the general population who hold that view. Here, middle-income consumers look more similar to high-income households. That trend holds true for some consumption attitudes, such as being willing to pay more for comfort and quality.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Middle-income consumers look more like the general population and low-income consumers when it comes to choosing less expensive products and being ahead of the curve trying new tech products. All told, middle-income consumption attitudes tend to follow the pattern of high-income individuals, but look more like low-income shoppers on more practical measures.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>Morning Consult Intelligence customers can access the platform </i><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>here</i></a><i>.
