Ukraine has said that the weapon would help its long-awaited counteroffensive, now in its second month, which has <a href=#>been making slow progress</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The news is expected to be announced on Friday as part of a new military aid package worth $800 million, people familiar with the decision told the Associated Press.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President Biden had long resisted calls to provide cluster munitions—which are currently sitting in U.S. stockpiles and on the verge of expiring—because of how controversial the weapons are globally. The small bomblets are banned in more than 120 countries because they pollute the battlefield with unexploded munitions and therefore kill civilians years after a conflict subsides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think it would be a major mistake for the Biden Administration to now change policy after resisting calls for transferring cluster munitions to Ukraine,” says Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a U.S. think tank.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Below, what to know about the weapons and the vigorous debate around them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukraine-cluster-bombs-featured.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What are cluster bombs?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cluster bombs, or cluster munitions, are weapons fired from an artillery unit or aircraft that release a larger number of smaller bomblets that disperse over a wide area on the battlefield.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Developed during World War II, they were originally intended to attack multiple targets, especially infantry, soft-skinned vehicles, and armor. However, they can also create a minefield of bombs that are difficult to track and can explode years later, injuring or killing civilians long after a war is over.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ukraine has asked the U.S. for dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICMs), a class of cluster munition that could be fired from <a href=# rel=noopener>howitzers</a> or from the <a href=#>HIMARs</a> rocket launchers that the country has been receiving for the past year.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Could cluster bombs make a difference on the battlefield?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The question has raised a heated debate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some experts say the use of cluster bombs could give Ukraine more time to clear a path through minefields by suppressing Russian fire from the trenches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cluster-bombs-ukraine-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.S. recognizes their potential as potent weapons that can break up enemy formations. In June, Pentagon official Laura Cooper <a href=# rel=noopener>told Congress</a> that the department’s military analysts had concluded that clusterbombs “would be useful, especially against dug-in Russian positions.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But others take a different view. Kimball, from the Arms Control Association, warns that while “cluster munitions may provide additional military value in certain limited situations, this is not some magical winning weapon for Ukraine in its ongoing offensive against Russia.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kimball adds that Ukraine’s tactical military needs could be met by “other types of conventional munitions,” which could include regular <a href=#>155-mm munitions</a>, as well as a <a href=# rel=noopener>new</a> type of artillery shell that can hit targets with greater precision.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How did the decision unfold?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At a press event last Friday, U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> that the decision-making process to send the bombs to Ukraine was “ongoing.” Milley also noted that Russian troops were already using them on the battlefield and that Ukrainian forces have already received them from other Western allies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some U.S. lawmakers have called on the Biden Administration to not send the weapons. Last week, for example, 14 senators <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a> a letter to the U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that while they recognize the munitions could provide Ukraine an advantage on the battlefield, they were “convinced that the humanitarian costs and damage to coalition unity of providing U.S. cluster munitions would outweigh the tactical benefits.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cluster-bombs-ukraine-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The decision to send them will bypass a U.S. law that prohibits the production, use, or export of cluster bombs with a failure rate higher than 1%. The last publicly available estimates—more than 20 years ago—of dud rates for the weapons have them at 6%. But The Washington Post <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> that the Pentagon has new assessments that put the dud rate at no more than 2.35%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That would mean that Biden will still need to bypass the legislation and Congress to supply Ukraine with the weapons.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What’s the long-term risk from cluster bombs?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Experts say cluster bombs have an immense capacity to cause destruction. “Cluster munitions are not just any conventional military weapon, they are widely acknowledged to pose a severe risk for civilians in conflict and even friendly forces,” Kimball says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to a 2019 <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> by the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, the weapons can turn trenches of a frozen conflict into “killing zones.” Civilians accounted for 97% of all cluster bomb casualties worldwide, with children accounting for 66% of the casualties, according to another <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> published by the advocacy group Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cluster-bombs-ukraine-4.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Cluster bombs are vile weapons that leave bomblets around for decades, and always cause enormous civilian casualties,” says Linda J. Bilmes, a professor who focuses on the costs of war at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2008, more than 100 nations signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an international treaty that came into force in 2010 and prohibits the use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of the deadly weapons. Only 16 countries—including the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia—have so far refused to sign the convention, according to Cluster Munition Monitor 2022.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, 27 House Democrats sent a <a href=# rel=noopener>letter</a> to Biden imploring him to join the Convention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlngHGEjq6iq5mZo7Jur8uuqq2domKvsLnBZpuempGpsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./9-facts-about-gymnasts-that-often-remain-behind-the-scenes-801080.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 Facts About Gymnasts That Often Remain Behind the Scenes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-chappell-roan-album-chart-billboard-15th-week-1236109924.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swifts Poets Tops Album Chart for a 15th Week, as Chappell Roan Reaches a New</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
