Over the same time period, the share of voters who said it is more important for them to agree with a candidate on abortion access than other issues declined slightly (from 39 to 36%).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Compared with the pre-midterms data from 2022, Republicans have become notably less insistent that candidates agree with their abortion stance (35% to 26%), as have women (44% to 38%). The latest survey shows women are equally likely to prioritize a candidate’s abortion stance as they are to give other issues higher footing, marking a sizable shift from the mid-2022 dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The latest survey comes as President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats work to revive the matter on the 2024 campaign trail, and as former President Donald Trump and Republicans nationwide deal with the fallout from the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Arizona Supreme Court's decision to allow a Civil War-era law that criminalizes nearly all abortions in the state unless a woman's life is at risk added pressure on the GOP. Ahead of the state Legislature’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>work to repeal the ban</a>, Trump and others in his party have sought to distance themselves from the Arizona law, with the presumptive Republican nominee even reversing his position as a 2016 presidential candidate and during his White House tenure by saying he would not sign a national abortion ban and that the issue should be left up to the states.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trump’s efforts to shift responsibility down the governmental ladder come at a moment when the question of whether abortion policy should be decided by federal or state government is divisive: 39% of voters (driven by the bulk of Democrats) say Washington should decide, compared with 40% of voters (driven by the bulk of Republicans) who opt for their state capitals.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But when it comes to the situation the country is facing, it’s Republicans in Washington who are taking much of the blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The majority of all voters (58%) said Trump is to blame for ending abortion rights nationally, including similar shares of women and independent voters. Notably, more voters (65%) hold Republicans in Congress responsible, though both numbers are smaller than the nearly 3 in 4 voters who blame the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Just a quarter of voters (27%) said they had seen, read or heard “a lot” about the Arizona Supreme Court’s upholding of the 1864 abortion law, and even fewer heard the same about Trump’s claim that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected president. Meanwhile, voters are far less likely to be hearing something “negative” about abortion policy than they were following the Dobbs decision</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This, coupled with voters’ heightened willingness to support candidates who may not agree with them about abortion, suggests the Biden campaign and Democrats will not be able to rely on the same type of political dynamics from the midterms to unfold naturally, even as similar shares of voters cast abortion as “very important” to their votes compared with<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> two years ago</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If Democrats want to revive similar energy around the issue this time around, they’ll likely need to double-down on efforts like the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Biden campaign’s abortion advertising blitz</a> to more broadly publicize the anti-abortion efforts taking place at the state level — and lean in to targeting places like Arizona where the issue is raw, and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>likely on the ballot this November</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5avsL7ToqanZaCkua21zaBka2hiaXqxvsSsoJ2dnqm2oriMnqOem6SevK8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1596862-actor-remi-shitta-bey-speaks-recovering-stroke-spends-n850k-month-drug.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actor Remi Shitta-Bey Speaks After Recovering From Stroke, Spends N850k per Month on Drug</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pulse-list-5-old-nollywood-movies-every-young-person-should-see.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 old Nollywood movies every young person should see</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
