Three in ten (31%) think it was average, and 12% believe the education they received was bad.</p><p>However, the answer seems to heavily depend on what type of school you went to.</p><p>Of those who attended a comprehensive school, just 45% reported that the education they received was good. For those who attended a grammar school, however, this figure is much higher, at 80%. This number is similar for those who attended a private school, of whom 77% rate their education as being good.</p><p>Those who went to a comprehensive were also the most likely to rate their education as being bad (15%) compared to private school (4%) and grammar school attendees (5%).</p><h3>What impact does school type have on career success?</h3><p>Where the debate around the existence of grammar and private school becomes most contentious is the implication for pupil’s career success. <a href=#>Research by the Sutton Trust has found</a> that a disproportionate number of well-paid jobs are occupied by the privately educated, for example finding that almost three quarters (74%) of top judges were educated privately.</p><p>Our research shows a large proportion of those who were state educated believe the type of school they went to has had an impact on their career success.</p><p>Of those who attended a comprehensive, 44% believe their job prospects would have been better if they had attended a private school, their career would have turned out much the same and only 3% believing they would have done worse.</p><p>They are less likely to believe going to a grammar school would have made any difference to their career than they are to believe going to a private school would have. Only a third (34%) believe they would have done better at a grammar school, with 44% believing they would have done much the same and just 3% believing they would have done worse.</p><p>When it comes to former grammar school pupils, they are much less likely than former comprehensive pupils to think their life would have been better had they attended a private school (27%). Half believe they would have done much the same (49%).</p><p>Should they have attended a comprehensive, rather than grammar school, one in three former grammar pupils believe their lives would have turned out worse as a result. Four in ten (41%) believe things would have panned out much the same.</p><p>By contrast, four in ten private school attendees (39%) think they would have done worse at a state comp, compared to 35% who think they would have done just as well.</p><h3>The vast majority of Britons think the school a child attends has an impact on their success – but other factors are seen as more important still</h3><p>Three quarters of Britons believe the school a child attends has a large impact (26%) or some impact (47%) on their chance of success. Only one in six (16%) think it has little impact, and just 6% say it has no impact at all.</p><p>Britons are, however, more likely to believe that the standard of teaching at school (89%) and a child’s own intelligence (88%) have a large or some impact on their success.</p><p>Similar numbers of people also believe that where a child lives and grows up and the amount of money their parents have as much of an impact on them as where they go to school, at 76% and 75% respectively.</p><p>A majority (55%) also think a child’s ethnicity has a large or moderate impact, while 41% think their gender plays into children’s success (with women more likely to think so than men, at 46% vs 35%).</p><h3>Britons are split on the future of private and state selective schools</h3><p>Despite the amount of influence Britons believe a school has on their future chances of success, there is limited support for phasing out private or state selective schools. On the question of banning private schools, just 21% would support a ban, while 30% would oppose it.</p><p>In her time as Prime Minister, Theresa May <a href=#>set aside money</a> for the opening of new selective schools, paving the way for a new generation of grammar schools. Britons are divided on this issue. One in five (20%) support the status quo, saying we should keep the current number of grammar schools and not open any more. Three in ten (29%) support opening more selective schools, while a similar number (27%) believe grammar schools should be scrapped altogether.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, opinion differs between those who attended a grammar school versus those who attended a non-selective state school. Of those who attended a grammar school, 47% support the building of further such schools, while just 22% of those who attended a non-selective state school feel the same.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZG59ennSrZitnV2rwG680aKtmqyVYrKlwcKaq6KnnmK1sMOMpqycoF2ZtqeyxKucp5uVYrGweQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./societes-publiques-locales-tout-sur-le-droit-rien-sur-largent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>tout sur le droit, rien sur l'argent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./extension-des-grandes-surfaces-les-senateurs-reparent-les-erreurs-de-la-lme.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les snateurs rparent les erreurs de la LME</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
