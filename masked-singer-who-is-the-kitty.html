With cryptic clues and a voice you recognize but can’t place, she has been duping the judges and audience alike.</strong></p><p>So who is the Kitty? And are <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> fans right about it being Jackie Evancho?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-dDnH1yuAg</p>Kitty performing “Dangerous Woman” by Ariana Grande on The Masked Singer</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Clues On&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 3</h3><p>In the <a href=#>first clues package</a>, the Kitty is seen on stage, with spectators in black and white cheering her on and watching through opera glasses. She says she “feels at home among the weird and wonderful.” The show is “a little bit of heaven,” where Kitty can “wipe the slate clean as the purest snow.” A wizard is shown and a telescope pointing to the moon. People think of her as the person she once was, not the person she’s become. We see a moon puffing out smoke. Now, she gets to start from scratch. Pirates are fighting in the background. She’s going for “high drama,” while we see a rose shatter and rose petals all around her.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>WATCH:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>OUR RECAP OF&nbsp;THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;SUPER 9 + ALL THE KITTY CLUES DECODED</a></strong></p><p>The <a href=#>second set of clues</a> brought even more hints. Kitty says she’s been “waiting for this moment forever.” Sewing is one of her favorite things to do, whether a pillow for someone special or a “modern dress for a family member’s ball.” She mentions she “draws on all that inspires her” while she is seen drawing. “Maybe there’s something about watching transformations rings a bell” to the Kitty. One of the men in black is seen wearing a red, hooded cape. She can feel herself growing into something “brand new.” Her favorite subject in school was English. She’s “such a bookworm” and says she used to write sci-fi books at school that she would sell for quarters.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>More Clues On&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 3</h4><p>Kitty had her “BFF” dish out some gossip about her for the <a href=#>third set of clues</a>. She is seen as a Rapunzel-like character with long green hair. Her BFF says she “didn’t have a ton of friends” and “got bullied at school for being weird” growing up. The clues show a decorative egg, adorned in diamonds and two candelabras. She mentions that Kitty has “always had a flair for the dramatic,” whether she’s writing poems or directing horror movies they would star in. We see Christmas lights hanging up. Her BFF mentions that she once said she could see ghosts and got detention. Kitty then gives a friendship bracelet to Robin. It says “FIREWORKS” on it. Kitty says she gave it to him because “the first time we met was lit!”</p><p>In the Super 9, the <a href=#>clues</a> were scarce. But Kitty did share a “super clue,” which was the&nbsp;<a href=# class=broken_link>Tree</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;season 2! She says she’s “not going to make this complicated, Christmas is truly the best time of year. Ring any jingle bells?” After her performance, she also explained “I was not dreaming when Robert Redford helped me to get my very first role.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>WHO IS THE TURTLE? THE MASKED SINGER CELEBRITY EXPOSED</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Kitty</h3><p>Predictions for The Masked Singer Kitty have been all over the place from the panelists and fans at home. The judges have guessed Julianne Hough, Paris Hilton, Millie Bobby Brown, Amanda Seyfried, Sarah Hyland, Christina Ricci, Kristen Bell, Haylie Duff, Nicole Richie, Vanessa Hudgens, and Emma Roberts. Phew! That’s quite a list and goes from pop culture icons to actresses to child stars.</p><p>Online, the most popular guesses are Lucy Hale, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Jackie Evancho, Elizabeth Gillies, and Kate Bosworth. It was honestly exhausting researching all these different options! But all of them have some tie to the clues and costume.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Our Prediction For The Kitty…Is It AGT‘s Jackie Evancho?</h2><p>Now, as we said before, the Kitty’s clues have been the hardest to decode. But after lining everything up, there’s only one answer. We can confirm the Kitty is…<strong>Jackie Evancho</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>Jackie Evancho is known for being a <a href=#>classical singer</a> from her time on AGT. We’ve seen opera glasses, a shattering glass rose, and talks of “high drama.” Her BFF mentioning the “voice of an angel” was also a nod to that. But now, Jackie is transitioning to pop music. She mentions a lot about watching transformations and not being “the person [she] once was.” These clues are also a nod to her time on AGT and evolution since then.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>WHO IS THE ASTRONAUT? ALL&nbsp;THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;CLUES DECODED!</a></strong></p><p>There have been a lot of mentions about the Kitty’s hobbies, which line up with Jackie’s. The Kitty loves sewing and writing, both things that Jackie Evancho enjoys doing. Clues referencing wizards point to her first television appearance on Wizards of Waverly Place. The pirates we’ve seen in clues are an homage to her hometown, Pittsburgh, where the Pirates are the local baseball team.</p><p>A few more specific clues point to Jackie as well. The red riding hood the Kitty wears references a 2009 school musical Jackie Evancho was in. The candelabras are from Phantom of the Opera, which inspired Jackie to start singing. And when she claimed it was “lit” meeting panelist Robin Thicke, that is an allusion to the <a href=# class=broken_link>Christmas Tree Lighting and Fireworks</a> they both performed at. This also explains the other Christmas clues and the Tree from season two. Finally, Kitty mentioned she got her first role with the help of Robert Redford. Jackie was in “The Company You Keep,” where she played his daughter.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Did We Get It Right?</h4><p>Did we miss any clues for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Kitty? There will be plenty more when Kitty, Banana, Frog, and Rhino perform again next Wednesday at 8/7c on FOX. But I have a feeling the Kitty will stick around for a while!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/coronavirus.jpg alt="Fact Check: Are Coronavirus Patients Being Cremated Alive?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZuewbXFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gillian-anderson-southbank-want-female-sexual-desire-1235958763.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gillian Anderson to Headline Southbank Literature Season With Her Book About Female Sexual Des</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./premiere-partie-du-projet-de-budget-2014-tous-les-amenagements-adoptes-par-les-deputes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>tous les amnagements adopts par les dputs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
