It’s prohibited to&nbsp;fly over the theme park without a&nbsp;special waiver. The restriction was introduced in&nbsp;2003 for security reasons, so&nbsp;now you will never see a&nbsp;plane or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;single drone flying over the park.</p><p>Disneyland’s staff invented two unique colors: “<strong>Go&nbsp;Away Green</strong>” and “<strong>Blending Blue</strong>”. They are specifically designed to&nbsp;make the guests’ eyes ignore them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/88c/ce2/8ea6d153e5bd7197b273f8ffaf.png><p>Go&nbsp;Away Green is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;color backstage buildings to&nbsp;“erase” them from the guests’ field of&nbsp;vision and camouflage all the temporary construction works going&nbsp;on. The idea is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;you don’t look for these objects specifically, your eyes will glaze over all the things painted in&nbsp;this color. Instead, you’ll focus on&nbsp;something more important, like attractions and finished buildings. Maybe you’ll even leave the park without realizing there was some construction going on&nbsp;in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;your eyes.</p><p>Blending Blue is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;make the building blend in&nbsp;with the <a href=# title=sky data-link=tag>sky</a>. Many buildings have their upper part painted into this special shade, so&nbsp;they don’t look as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;they are. For the park in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a>, the color was adjusted to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;match Florida’s regular sky shade.</p><p>Go&nbsp;Away Green and Blending Blue are often used together to&nbsp;paint the buildings that Disneyland doesn’t want you to&nbsp;see. The bottom part of&nbsp;the building is&nbsp;usually painted with Go&nbsp;Away Green until about the height of&nbsp;the trees, and the rest is&nbsp;painted in&nbsp;blue to&nbsp;blend with the sky and make the building less noticeable. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, you mostly enjoy the beautiful attractions and Disney magic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/468/0d2/8ef2c15784848a4ece5f90ac93.png><p>Disneyland also uses colors and forced perspective to&nbsp;make some buildings appear bigger than they are. One of&nbsp;those buildings is&nbsp;Sleeping Beauty’s castle. The bricks used at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the castle are smaller than the ones at&nbsp;the bottom, and the castle appears taller.</p><p>They use scents as&nbsp;well to&nbsp;make the park more appealing. Around the park, there are many odor-pumping machines hidden inside the buildings. These smells are important because they contribute to&nbsp;your Disneyland experience, making it&nbsp;more pleasurable and memorable. People say that several places in&nbsp;Disneyland have very distinctive smells that are as&nbsp;familiar as&nbsp;the buildings.</p><p>Adults aged 14&nbsp;and older aren’t allowed to&nbsp;wear costumes in&nbsp;Disneyland. You can only wear some Disney-inspired accessories like Minnie Mouse ears or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Frozen T-shirt. If&nbsp;you wear the full costume, you won’t be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;enter the park until you change. This is&nbsp;made so&nbsp;that guests don’t confuse you with the cast members of&nbsp;Disneyland who represent the characters.</p><p>It&nbsp;can become hard and confusing to&nbsp;find Disney’s Cinderella if&nbsp;there are a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;fake ones walking around the park. But if&nbsp;you really want to&nbsp;dress up&nbsp;like your favorite character, you can take your trip to&nbsp;Disneyland during the Halloween season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/940/cef/e01a77554c8a569b0c68325e9a.png><p>During this time, it’s perfectly fine to&nbsp;walk around like you just walked out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Disney movie. Only remember that, due to&nbsp;safety reasons, your costume can’t reach the ground or&nbsp;drag on&nbsp;it. Also, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;happens that someone confuses you with a&nbsp;Disney character, you can’t pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one, take pictures, or&nbsp;give autographs.</p><p>Disneyland has banned selfie sticks, so&nbsp;don’t pack one. They’re on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;prohibited items along with drones (remember&nbsp;— nothing can fly over Disneyland), large tripods, and remote-control toys. This is&nbsp;again done for safety, after one guest pulled out a&nbsp;selfie stick in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;ride. Also, people used to&nbsp;drop them on&nbsp;rides, which is&nbsp;unsafe either.</p><p>Another item on&nbsp;the ban list is&nbsp;a&nbsp;folding chair. It’s cool to&nbsp;have one and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;arrange a&nbsp;seating place anywhere, especially while waiting in&nbsp;line. But leave it&nbsp;at&nbsp;home and better enjoy Disneyland’s benches. No&nbsp;one will let you in&nbsp;with a&nbsp;chair.</p><p>If&nbsp;your friend is&nbsp;celebrating their birthday in&nbsp;Disneyland and you came with a&nbsp;gift, remember that the gift shouldn’t be&nbsp;wrapped. The security person has to&nbsp;see what the gift is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make sure it’s nothing that is&nbsp;prohibited in&nbsp;the park, so&nbsp;they’ll make you unwrap it&nbsp;anyways. All the cast members have to&nbsp;keep their job a&nbsp;secret. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;staff member plays a&nbsp;certain Disney character in&nbsp;the park, they’re not allowed to&nbsp;tell it&nbsp;to&nbsp;anyone, reveal their character or&nbsp;discuss their role with anyone but with other cast members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ae/6dc/83f49951faae525cabd63d9191.png><p>To&nbsp;get around this rule, staff members can tell their friends and relatives that “they’re friends” with the character they actually play. Also, it’s not allowed to&nbsp;write about their job on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, take any photos in&nbsp;a&nbsp;costume or&nbsp;any backstage photos, and especially post them anywhere. All to&nbsp;preserve the Disney magic. Cast members should take their job seriously and be&nbsp;the best character actor.</p><p>After a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;hired, they undergo mandatory training to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the character they will portray. Also, they can’t choose what character they will play, it’s decided for them. After getting the role, they have to&nbsp;watch movies with the character hundreds of&nbsp;times, learn their story, learn to&nbsp;talk and behave exactly like them. Whatever happens, cast members must stay in&nbsp;character every second they’re working. Whatever they&nbsp;do, they should do&nbsp;it&nbsp;like their character.</p><p>Chip and Dale act goofy all the time, Maleficent should act mean, and Ariel constantly makes references to&nbsp;the ocean. All the Disneyland staff should also be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;answer any question a&nbsp;guest might ask correctly. This means that the actor should live in&nbsp;the universe of&nbsp;the character completely, and it’s forbidden to&nbsp;mention any characters that were not in&nbsp;the original story or&nbsp;to&nbsp;show that they know anything about life outside of&nbsp;Disneyland.</p><p>If&nbsp;you ask them what’s their favorite social media app, they will ask you what social media&nbsp;is. Also, cast members are trained to&nbsp;give autographs. Every Disney character has their own unique autograph, and even though there are different people portraying these characters, the autograph should always look the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0bd/45c/9eb2bb597ab5aa3be7827b15d3.png><p>If&nbsp;you compare one you got today with the one you got five years ago, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;the same, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the same person gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;you. What makes the whole thing harder for the staff, is&nbsp;that one actor can portray several characters. Usually, each person portrays two or&nbsp;three characters, which means they have to&nbsp;undergo special training for each of&nbsp;them and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;switch roles pretty quickly. One day you’re sweet Snow White and the next you’re fearless and independent Merida.</p><p>To&nbsp;make their guests’ experience as&nbsp;pleasurable as&nbsp;possible, the staff does a&nbsp;great job keeping the park clean. Every staff member, no&nbsp;matter who they are&nbsp;— a&nbsp;gardener, Goofy or&nbsp;Princess Aurora, should pick up&nbsp;every piece of&nbsp;trash they see along the way. Of&nbsp;course, they should do&nbsp;it&nbsp;gracefully and nonchalantly, so&nbsp;nobody even pays attention to&nbsp;it. And guess what, they undergo special training to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;trash like a&nbsp;true Disney character.</p><p>To&nbsp;preserve the magic and not ruin the guests’ experience with unpleasant things and mentions, employees also use a&nbsp;secret language. They use many codes so&nbsp;that guests don’t hear what they’re not supposed to&nbsp;hear. Code <strong>101</strong> means that something isn’t functioning, and code <strong>102</strong>&nbsp;is used when everything’s back to&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Don’t be&nbsp;too flattered if&nbsp;some cast member calls you a&nbsp;“treasured guest”. People do&nbsp;misbehave in&nbsp;Disneyland, often trying to&nbsp;provoke the staff. But cast members must stay in&nbsp;character, even if&nbsp;it’s hard&nbsp;to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cec/421/7ddaa356b58ac983d8660cc0e8.png><p>If&nbsp;some guest causes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;trouble and is&nbsp;very irritating, a&nbsp;staff member can refer to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“treasured guest” to&nbsp;let off some steam or&nbsp;to&nbsp;warn their co-worker about the person’s attitude. Also, if&nbsp;someone is&nbsp;being especially rude, they can be&nbsp;politely but insistently seen out of&nbsp;Disneyland by&nbsp;security.</p><p>People who misbehave&nbsp;— for example, try to&nbsp;cut a&nbsp;power line or&nbsp;break some ride rules, can be&nbsp;banned from the park for a&nbsp;year. In&nbsp;case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;more serious offense, the park management can even ban a&nbsp;person from visiting both Disneyland and Disney World indefinitely.</p><p>In&nbsp;Disneyland, all staff members call each other by&nbsp;their first names. But if&nbsp;there are several people working at&nbsp;the same place and bearing the same names, it&nbsp;can get confusing. So, if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;already one girl working in&nbsp;Disneyland whose name is&nbsp;<strong>Ava</strong>, when another Ava joins the team, the new girl will get a&nbsp;temporary replacement name. She will wear a&nbsp;tag with her new name while at&nbsp;work and will be&nbsp;called that the entire time she’s there.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYypo5qmlah6pK3NrWSfpKlivLex0Waboquemsatrc2dZHFpZGmAdXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1425801-american-rapper-young-ma-shuts-down-pregnancy-rumors-new-comment-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>American rapper Young M.A Shuts Down Pregnancy Rumors with New Comment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./48648-when-do-britons-think-you-are-supposed-to-call-999.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>When do Britons think you are supposed to call 999?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
