Here are the memories that never fail to&nbsp;make them feel happier!</p><p><h2>1.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c18/273/c3fbfb5cf5acb7985a1a92e91b.jpg><p>Mine would be&nbsp;when&nbsp;I first started talking to&nbsp;my&nbsp;SO. I&nbsp;had been asking co-workers about her for a&nbsp;while and then&nbsp;I found out that she was asking about me&nbsp;as&nbsp;well. We&nbsp;would talk here and there, but&nbsp;I never had the guts to&nbsp;ask her on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date. When I&nbsp;finally built up&nbsp;the courage to&nbsp;ask her out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date, she was saying yes before&nbsp;I even asked! We&nbsp;were laughing like school girls because&nbsp;I literally only asked if&nbsp;I could ask her something.</p><p>It&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;smile because&nbsp;I always had low self-esteem and underestimated how much&nbsp;I was worth in&nbsp;the sense of&nbsp;what&nbsp;I could bring to&nbsp;the table in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. Having her love and support just makes me&nbsp;so&nbsp;incredibly happy now and that memory just stands out during the good and the hard times. @<a href=#>moarcheeseplz</a></p><p><h2>2.</h2></p><p>About a&nbsp;year ago, I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;discount grocery store. I&nbsp;had about $20 left after bills and rent, so&nbsp;I was having to&nbsp;carefully pick and choose what to&nbsp;buy. In&nbsp;the end, after hemming and hawing for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes over whether&nbsp;I could afford to&nbsp;spend $6&nbsp;on <a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a>, I&nbsp;put it&nbsp;back on&nbsp;the shelf and went to&nbsp;the register.</p><p>As&nbsp;I’m walking out of&nbsp;the shop, I&nbsp;hear a&nbsp;woman call after&nbsp;me: “Young man, you forgot this,” I&nbsp;turn around and she thrusts the jar of&nbsp;coffee into my&nbsp;bag, I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;protest and she cuts me&nbsp;off by&nbsp;saying: “I&nbsp;remember what it&nbsp;was like, not having enough money and having to&nbsp;go&nbsp;without. You take that coffee and enjoy&nbsp;it, friend,” with the biggest smile on&nbsp;her face. She was like a&nbsp;beacon of&nbsp;light during one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;darkest times, and&nbsp;I always remember her, with every cup of&nbsp;coffee, I&nbsp;can’t help but smile. Because now each cup reminds me&nbsp;that there are truly good people in&nbsp;the world. @<a href=#>GlalD</a></p><p><h2>3.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89b/6f9/fa9dee5324a051e9072771ca62.jpg><p>My&nbsp;son when he&nbsp;was like 3&nbsp;on a&nbsp;hike&nbsp;— beautiful woods&nbsp;— he&nbsp;made his way up&nbsp;a&nbsp;decent sized hill and at&nbsp;the top muttered... “happy.” @<a href=#>as012qwe</a></p><p><h2>4.</h2></p><p>My&nbsp;mom found out she had stage 4&nbsp;lung cancer when&nbsp;I was 2&nbsp;and passed away when&nbsp;I was 6. When she got diagnosed, she was given 6&nbsp;months to&nbsp;live&nbsp;so, needless to&nbsp;say, she gave&nbsp;us lots of&nbsp;amazing memories and really lived in&nbsp;the moment.</p><p>The one story&nbsp;I always tell when talking about my&nbsp;mom was how, one day, she let me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;older sister stay home, which was a&nbsp;big deal in&nbsp;the 1st and 3rd grade already. We&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Bulk Barn and got EVERY item we&nbsp;wanted. When we&nbsp;got home, we&nbsp;snuggled in&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’ bed, spread out what felt like a&nbsp;never-ending amount of&nbsp;bags of&nbsp;chocolate and candy, and watched <a href=# title=Disney data-link=tag>Disney</a> movies all afternoon. When my&nbsp;dad came home from work, he&nbsp;just jumped right in&nbsp;and joined&nbsp;us.</p><p>It&nbsp;was right before she went into hospice and the last “good day” I&nbsp;remember her having before she passed, so&nbsp;that memory holds a&nbsp;special place in&nbsp;my&nbsp;heart. @<a href=#>importantsphere</a></p><p><h2>5.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a5/b7a/f443765d9394ae4102d87b477d.jpg><p>My&nbsp;favorite <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> memory&nbsp;is, and always will&nbsp;be, sitting at&nbsp;the kitchen table, having a&nbsp;coffee with my&nbsp;mom. We&nbsp;would just sit and talk for hours about everything, over a&nbsp;pot of&nbsp;coffee. Truthfully, every time&nbsp;I have coffee, I&nbsp;think of&nbsp;those times and smile. @<a href=#>WVUEnchilada</a></p><p><h2>6.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;was 9&nbsp;and it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;first time visiting Disney and vacationing in&nbsp;the States. Living in&nbsp;the tropics, I&nbsp;couldn’t get used to&nbsp;the cold summer nights in&nbsp;California (you read that right), and came down with a&nbsp;mild fever.</p><p>Was pretty down after realizing&nbsp;I wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;catch the fireworks display, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad snuck me&nbsp;out when my&nbsp;mom was busy looking after my&nbsp;brother. He&nbsp;carried me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the castle where&nbsp;I saw fireworks for the first time in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.

That week was the best, since&nbsp;I love my&nbsp;grandmother. We&nbsp;would scrapbook, sew, bake cookies, and do&nbsp;puzzles together. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;spend time with her like that. She was my&nbsp;favorite person in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>I&nbsp;loved my&nbsp;grandmother so&nbsp;much, that when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;little kid, “what&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;when&nbsp;I grew&nbsp;up” was a&nbsp;grandmother. @<a href=#>FrogginBullfish_</a></p><p><h2>13.</h2></p><p>My&nbsp;mom would sing and dance in&nbsp;the kitchen every Sunday morning when&nbsp;I was growing&nbsp;up. Times were always tough and money was always tight, but my&nbsp;mom always made sure we&nbsp;were happy and healthy.</p><p>One particular day when&nbsp;I was 8, I&nbsp;was woken up&nbsp;by&nbsp;the sound of&nbsp;Gloria Gaynor’s “I&nbsp;Will Survive” blasting through the house, and my&nbsp;mom singing off-key. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;walked to&nbsp;the kitchen the smell of&nbsp;chorizo and eggs filled the air, and there&nbsp;I saw her. My&nbsp;mom, who only a&nbsp;few days earlier looked so&nbsp;miserable with her life, was dancing her heart out with a&nbsp;spatula in&nbsp;her hand. @<a href=#>100thatpetty</a></p><p><h2>14.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/249/ee4/a45c6850f48e4bf1a5863eb346.jpg><p>Well, I&nbsp;was hitting a&nbsp;real low point and my&nbsp;friend invited me&nbsp;over.

She was the maid of&nbsp;honor at&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I were supposed to&nbsp;dance to&nbsp;the song “Tightrope” from The Greatest Showman. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;walk onto the dancefloor, the&nbsp;DJ announces this will be&nbsp;our first dance...“but I&nbsp;don’t think they know that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;recording from [sister].”</p><p>My&nbsp;sister recorded herself singing the song (which she didn’t know we&nbsp;had picked) while a&nbsp;friend played piano for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;dance&nbsp;to. I&nbsp;cried a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding day (all happy), but nothing made me&nbsp;cry harder than that. I’m crying now just remembering&nbsp;it. She told me&nbsp;afterward how hard it&nbsp;was for her to&nbsp;work up&nbsp;the courage to&nbsp;sing&nbsp;it, record&nbsp;it, everything it&nbsp;involved, but she loved me&nbsp;and wanted to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;something special. This will never not make me&nbsp;cry. @<a href=#>werekitty93</a></p><p>Which memories always make you smile?
