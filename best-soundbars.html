Not only will a quality soundbar enhance the sound profile of your movies, shows, and video games, the best models sport convenient features such as automatic AI audio balancing, voice controls for selecting the music you want to play the instant it pops into your head, and a concert-like surround sound listening experience with the aid of superior sound technologies such as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. With so many brands, models, and types of soundbars available today, there is certainly one to match the size of your TV room, listening needs, and budget. After many hours of researching and listening, I’ve put together a list of the best soundbars of the year.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-soundbars>How to choose the best soundbars</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when shopping for a soundbar is to look for a model that fits your TV and viewing area. Your soundbar needs to fit in the space underneath the TV or be mounted securely above it, and your display should be wider than the soundbar.</p><h3>Sound quality</h3><p>Unlike shopping for <a rel=alternate href=#>wireless earbuds</a>, sound quality matters more than ever when choosing a soundbar. While audio-enhancing features such as Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support are signs of an impressive-sounding soundbar, note that models with a high number of channels tend to produce a fuller and more immersive listening experience. When referring to soundbars, a “channel” notes how many directions the speakers are oriented in.For example, a soundbar with a 5.1 channel will beam audio in five directions, and includes a subwoofer for enhancing low-frequency sounds. Soundbars designed with more channels feature a richer surround sound effect and an all-around superior audio performance.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>If you’re having a difficult time choosing between two or more soundbars, try comparing their respective feature lists to see which incorporates more useful qualities. Some particularly handy options to look out for include smart assistant-based voice controls such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, smart home integration with platforms like Apple AirPlay 2 and Chromecast, multiple audio modes that help movies, music, and video games sound even better, an integrated LED display, and a physical remote control.</p><h3>Connectivity</h3><p>Although soundbars are almost universally compatible with all modern TVs, it’s worth double-checking to ensure that the soundbar you’re considering will connect to your game consoles, Blu-ray player, streaming platforms, and mobile devicesIf your favorite devices rely on a specific connection type such as HDMI, optical, or 3.5mm audio inputs, take the time to see if your top soundbar picks include all of the matching connections you need. Note that many soundbars also feature connectivity via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This makes it extremely easy to wirelessly play music from your PC, smartphone, tablet, and other devices.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Since soundbars range from as low as $150 to well over $3,000, with the average costing between $200 and $600, there is absolutely a soundbar for everyone’s budget. A number of factors will influence the price of a soundbar, including size, brand, range of features, and overall quality.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-soundbars>Our top picks for the best soundbars</h2><h3>Best premium soundbar: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sony HT-A7000 7.1.2ch Dolby Atmos Soundbar</a></h3><p>Only serious audiophiles will spend $1,400 on a soundbar, but those who do will be blown away by the Sony HT-A7000’s lifelike 3D sound mapping, which provides a truly cinematic listening experience from every direction.

The most important features I noted were their respective sound experiences, technologies and feature lists, range of connectivity options, and cost.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-soundbar>What is a soundbar?</h2><p>In a nutshell, a soundbar is a collection of little speakers placed within a thin, narrow case that is easy to set up alongside your TV. A quality soundbar will enhance your current television with advanced audio features such as Dolby Atmos, 3D spatial sound, DTS:X, and speech-clarifying AI for a more powerful, clearer, and immersive listening experience.</p><h2 id=how-do-soundbars-work>How do soundbars work?</h2><p>The average soundbar sports a number of internal speakers, angled in different directions to create an immersive surround sound effect throughout the room. Some soundbars include a companion subwoofer speaker for deeper bass and enhancing low-frequency noises. The speakers send sound waves in all directions to fill the room with sound for a theater-like listening experience.Soundbars work with an array of entertainment devices, including TVs, video game consoles, PCs, and even smartphones via a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do soundbars connect to a TV?</h3><p>There are many ways to connect a soundbar to a TV, but the best method for your setup depends on which ports your display has. The best and most common option is an HDMI cable, for transmitting extremely high-quality audio from your TV to the soundbar for the best sound possible.Simply connect one end of the HDMI cable to the ARC or eARC port of your TV, and insert the other into the soundbar’s OUT HDMI port.</p><p>Alternate options include using an optical cable, or in rare cases, an analog connection. The analog ports on your TV and soundbar may be noted as 3.5mm or AUX.</p><p>Although a wired connection will always provide a superior sound, a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi option may be your best choice if you want to avoid the annoyances of cable management.</p><h3>Where do I place my soundbar?</h3><p>Generally speaking, the two best locations to set up your soundbar are either above or below your TV.</p><p>It is effortless to set a soundbar underneath your TV, and most were designed for this position, as it’s easier to connect to your display and effectively beam sound both directly at the viewer and all over the room. Just be sure not to place the device directly in front of the screen itself or its remote control sensor, and your soundbar will be good to go.</p><p>If your TV is mounted on the wall, it may be a good idea to mount its companion soundbar above the display. This setup will allow the soundbar to project audio upwards and around the area, giving your entertainment an additional layer of depth as you look up at the TV. This layout works well if you angle the front of the soundbar towards the viewers instead of the ceiling and avoid covering your TV’s ventilation holes.</p><h3>Why do I need a soundbar?</h3><p>There are many reasons to pair a quality soundbar with your TV. For example, if your current TV’s audio is underwhelming, but you don’t want to invest in either a new display or an expensive home theater setup, a soundbar is a thrifty way to upgrade your movies, shows, and video games with impressively rich, crisp, and detailed sound.</p><p>In addition to being relatively affordable, a soundbar is a snap to set up right out of the box, effortlessly pairs with most TVs, andtakes up much less room than traditional bulky surround sound speakers.</p><h3>How long do soundbars last?</h3><p>The average soundbar should last anywhere from five to over 15 years, depending on the quality of the device and how well it’s cared for over time. A premium name-brand soundbar will be constructed with quality materials and components to endure for many years to come, so buyers should consider investing in a nicer model that is likely to outlive a cheaper and less impressive alternative.
