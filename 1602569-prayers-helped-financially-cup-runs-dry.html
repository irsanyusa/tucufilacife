I consider myself one of your favourite children because I have seen how mighty your hand is. Dear Lord, as I kneel here and give my praise, I thank you for my friend who came through for me during my financial obstacles. I pray my friend is well and that you may fill their come. Amen.</li><li>What could I have done without you, dear God? You have held my hand and made me reach the levels I have. You have opened doors for me and sent me friends who have helped me get better financially. I worship you, dear Lord, for every decision you have made has been to better my life. Thank you to my friends, and I pray they keep doing the good work, not just for me but for other people in their lives, too. Amen.</li><li>I praise you and lift your name high, Jehovah Lord. You have been good to my friends and me; we are grateful. This month, I dedicate all my prayers to my friends who helped me when I needed financial aid. I thank you for the friends who helped me with funds, those who bought me basic necessities and those who came to be with me when I had no penny; bless them, Lord and make them keep the same spirit. Amen.</li><li>Heavenly Father, I am on my knees to acknowledge the financial help you sent me and my family. We are very grateful to you. I pray that this helper remains faithful to you and humble when your name is mentioned. Amen.</li><li>I feel blessed to be who I am every day I wake up. God, you have been grateful to me and given me a tight-knit friendship circle that always has my back. As I pray, I am humbled that you sent a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1437782-jonas-max-ferris-biography-who-dagen-mcdowells-husband.html href=#>financial adviser</a> who came my way as a friend. Jehovah God, I will forever lift your name high because, through my friend, I could plan my finances and invest. Thank you for always sending the right people to my corner, for without them and your guidance, I would have lost direction. Amen.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ef7d7351805b68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 paragraphs for your crush to express how you feel about them</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/bff8fc2c89d907dd.jpeg><ul><li>Receive my most profound gratitude, oh Lord. You are my father, and you see me through all my struggles. Oh God. I'm praying for my friend, who has been nothing but good to me. He has shown me the true meaning of friendship and even made me know you more. I thank you for my friend who helped me when I had nothing to feed. I pray that he may never lack, oh God. Thank you for the people you brought to my life. Amen.</li><li>This prayer is for my friend in dire need of help. She was there with me through thick and thin, and now she is in trouble. Good Lord, I pray that you help her navigate the situation she is in right now. She helped me regain my financial muscle, and I am intentional about doing the same. Sweet Jesus, please give me the energy and resources to help my friend; she is the only true friend who helped me financially. Amen.</li><li>I come before your altar as your child. You have never forsaken me, my father, and for that, I am thankful. The Bible says that two people are better than one, for they can help each other better, and I can attest that having someone to help you is a blessing. Thank you, God, for bringing people into my life. People that not only celebrate with me but also stand with me during my lowest moments. Amen.</li><li>My Jesus, my Lord, I come to you this morning as your humble servant. I am praising and asking you to bless this person who helped me financially because, without them, I would not be stabbed right now. Thank you to my friends who helped me rebuild my business and regain my house. I am forever grateful, and I pray that you keep blessing them.</li><li>Dear God, I am here to express my <a href=#>heartfelt gratitude</a> to the person you sent to help me with the money. He is a blessing to me as I've been in need. Your word in Luke 6:38 says, "Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ce0b3cc09b6bf89e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ emotional deep best friend paragraphs to show your appreciation</span></p></a><h2 id=1602569-how-do-you-pray-for-someone-who-gave-you-money class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How do you pray for someone who gave you money?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ef7d7351805b68d.jpeg><p class=align-left>You <a href=#>can</a> say several prayers to someone who helped you financially.
