Face-to-face communication is quite intimidating but the most romantic way to woo a woman. Use this format to <a href=#>toast a girl</a> you can physically meet regularly:</p><h4 id=1083632-1-observe-the-girl39s-behaviour-before-approaching-her class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. Observe the girl's behaviour before approaching her</h4><p class=align-left>Observe the lady for a few weeks or months to know if she has a man in her life, the places she frequently visits, the people she often interacts with, her best friends, and so on.</p><h4 id=1083632-2-introduce-yourself-but-do-not-let-her-notice-your-intentions class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Introduce yourself but do not let her notice your intentions</h4><p class=align-left>Find enticing ways of introducing yourself and ensure you get her number at this stage. One way is to make friends with one of the girl's friends. The day you spot them together, walk towards them for a little chat and let the girl's friend introduce you to each other.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c86ebb9222a9ef92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>53 things to do with your girlfriend that will be fun for both of you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Alternatively, do not use a third party. Sit next to her in class, church, library, or other public places. Introduce yourself right away or after sitting beside her severally. You can request your friend to sit between you and her if you are tense.</p><h4 id=1083632-3-befriend-her-but-not-for-too-long-lest-she-friend-zones-you class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Befriend her but not for too long lest she friend zones you</h4><p class=align-left>Avail yourself when she invites you to events and make it up to her if you miss. Invite her to events, too but do not make it look like a date. Your friends can also invite her to events on your behalf, or you can show up at any occasion she is attending if it is open for everyone.</p><h4 id=1083632-4-prove-you-are-a-reliable-friend class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Prove you are a reliable friend</h4><p class=align-left>Keep the communication flowing and help her when she needs you. Compliment her and give her little gifts if you can afford them.

She will not mind the gift's price if she genuinely likes you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2b728602a13afc47.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ classy beautiful woman quotes to inspire and motivate you</span></p></a><h4 id=1083632-5-avoid-being-friend-zoned class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Avoid being friend-zoned</h4><p class=align-left>Remember that the goal is to avoid making her think you only want to be her friend. Therefore, when you two get close enough, let your gestures send her a message regarding your intentions to date her. For example, hold her hand to see her reaction, maintain eye contact when talking, and so on.</p><h4 id=1083632-6-ask-her-out-on-a-date class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. Ask her out on a date</h4><p class=align-left>Ask her on a date after a few weeks or months of friendship. Be open-minded because she might accept it or turn you down. If she turns you down, do not be quick to cut her off.</p><p class=align-left>Make her a friend and assure her that you will not rush her to date you. A girl who genuinely likes you will explain why she rejected your date invitation, or you will find out on your own.</p><p class=align-left>You might have to take her on a few more dates to assure her that you genuinely like her. After that, it is upon you to decide how much money you want to spend on her. Two or three dates are enough for you to know if she is only after money and a good time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60a8e66c1565c224.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to compliment a girl: 50+ ways to make a lady feel special</span></p></a><h4 id=1083632-7-do-not-pressure-her-to-be-your-girlfriend class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7. Do not pressure her to be your girlfriend</h4><p class=align-left>It takes about three or four months after the first date for a woman to admit she loves you.

Slide into her inbox without revealing your intentions</h4><p class=align-left>Find ways to chat privately in her inbox without her realizing that you are wooing her. Grab opportunities when they present themselves. For instance, she can post adverts for goods/services, job vacancies, events, etc.</p><p class=align-left>Slide into her inbox to inquire more, even if the post is of no use to you. If she is excited to talk about it, move to the next step and toast the girl till she goes crazy for you.</p><h4 id=1083632-4-befriend-her-without-exposing-your-feelings-for-her class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4.

Ask her out on a blind date</h4><p class=align-left>If you are sure that she is honest and trustworthy, you can take her out on a blind date. Be romantic when asking her out.

He stated:</p>You can only get to some ladies through the same door. So you must know which of the door works for the particular lady of your interests. Once you discover what moves her heart, invest in that spot continuously, and you will notice that the more you get her attention, the more your confidence builds.<p class=align-left>Dr. Sam suggested that men exude positive lyrical vibes to captivate a lady's attention when introducing conversation topics. He emphasized that incorporating charisma through speech or actions is a seamless way to consistently win a place in the lady's heart. The expert said:</p>While investing many emotions, you must display your charisma, friendliness, and positive gestures towards her that will make her very comfortable around you. Some guys do this unconsciously without knowing how far these have registered in the girl's heart. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8c9bdb87ab788006.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to be a better boyfriend: 33 easy ways you can improve</span></p></a>That is why the girl feels jilted when he eventually goes after another lady, even though he hasn't officially established any relationship with the one he has been with all this while.<p class=align-left>In conclusion, Dr. Sam highlighted the typical factors men often consider before entering a relationship.
