But soon afterwards, the future Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army received a brief, secret note from Allen: “I hope you will come to Fire Island. Don’t be nervous, it is O.K. with me. (Signed) A friend in need is a friend indeed. …” A few months later, Lieut. Colonel George Catlett Marshall became Allen’s stepfather.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Katherine Marshall has written what she frankly calls “this homespun account” because “General Marshall has told me that he will never write his own memoirs, his knowledge of people and events being too intimate for publication.” The result is a friendly, chatty, modest collection of data and trivia that rarely goes beyond the bounds of domesticity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Katherine Marshall began to glimpse her new husband’s extraordinary military qualities when she followed him to Fort Moultrie, S.C., where he commanded the 8th Infantry, in 1933. “No detail was too small for his attention, no soldier too lowly. … If the post was shabby, with poorly kept grounds, he began fixing up his own garden and lawn; and within a few weeks all the lawns and gardens down the line began to take on a different complexion. There was never a word said, rarely an order given.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Usually, says Author Marshall, her husband “would start [a new job] with the . . . enthusiasm of a young lieutenant on his first assignment.” But when, in 1933, approaching a colonel’s retirement age, he was ordered to leave his regiment and become Senior Instructor of the Illinois National Guard, he dashed off a letter to Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur, pleading that such a shift would be “fatal to his future.” MacArthur was adamant, and for months Author Marshall watched her husband go about his new duties with “a grey, drawn look.” When Colonel Marshall’s generalcy came through in 1936, husband and wife sat staring at each other, speechless.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Through the long, exhausting war years the General went home in the evenings, too tired even to talk. She saw to it that he had plenty of relaxing books to read (“my husband [goes] through a pile of books with the avidity of a swarm of locusts . . .”). Once he was in bed, she answered his phone calls all through the night. Usually the calls came from enthusiastic civilians who could hardly wait to tell the General about their brand-new scheme for destroying enemy tanks, etc. But once, at 3 a.m., when Mrs. Marshall had patiently insisted that she be allowed to take the message, the voice at the other end snapped indignantly: “Yes, I’ll give you the message. This is the Times-Herald, and when the General wakes up you can tell him the War Department is on fire” (it was, but just a small blaze).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the closest of General Marshall’s friends was the late Field Marshal Sir John Dill, chief of the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington. One day the two war leaders changed into civvies and took a busman’s holiday, visiting Gettysburg. After listening to the guide’s account of the battle, the two “civilians” politely asked him to let them go on alone. He replied icily: “Certainly, if you men are not interested in military affairs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Author Marshall keeps the customary treasured scrapbook in which she pastes letters from the General’s admirers the world over. Sample letter:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dear Boss:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We are just in from Fort Dix, New Jersey, on our way to Fort Bragg, N.C. The service was good but the coffee (?) was cold. Will Confederate uniforms be issued after we pass Washington? Also will Confederate money be honored at the Post Exchange?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Love and kisses,<br>‘The Boys’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucmhkaoBws8SnnKuZnKh6uLXFnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ski-resorts-snowmaking-climate-change.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Greener Snowmaking Helps Ski Resorts Weather Climate Change</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./11-magical-places-that-inspired-fairy-tale-movies-717610.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Magical Places That Inspired Fairytale Movies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
