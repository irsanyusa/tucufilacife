She’s intelligent and sometimes shy, and has a&nbsp;charming personality. Andie is&nbsp;64&nbsp;now, and she says that she’s not ashamed of&nbsp;her age.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;learn more about the life and <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> of&nbsp;this talented actress, and her attitude toward the way she looks and her age.</p><p><h2>Mommy’s girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cc/e66/d277ba5bbc95aac5ed2ecbc6f2.jpg><p>Andie MacDowell was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;April&nbsp;21, 1958 to&nbsp;a&nbsp;music teacher and a&nbsp;lumber executive. Her parents divorced when she was 6&nbsp;years old. Andie is&nbsp;really proud of&nbsp;her mother, who went back to&nbsp;school and got her diploma after having 4&nbsp;girls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/637/093/d0732758b8940e847893026622.jpg><p>Photo on&nbsp;the left: Andie MacDowell (on&nbsp;the right) with her mother and sister.</p><p>In&nbsp;high <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a>, Andie was on&nbsp;the pep squad. During her teen years, she had a&nbsp;part-time job at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fast-food restaurant. After she graduated from school in&nbsp;1976, she entered Winthrop College and studied there for 2&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>Modeling career</h2></p><p>During her trip to&nbsp;Los Angeles, Andie Macdowell was noticed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;modeling scout. And in&nbsp;1978, she signed a&nbsp;contract with Elite Model Management.</p><p>In&nbsp;the early 1980s, she modeled for <i><a href=# title=Vogue data-link=tag>Vogue</a></i> magazine and appeared in&nbsp;advertising <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>campaigns</a> for Yves Saint Laurent and Armani. At&nbsp;that time, she already proved to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;creative and unique personality. Once, she came to&nbsp;the fashion show wearing jeans and a&nbsp;T-shirt. After taking part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Calvin Klein advertising campaign, she was noticed by&nbsp;representatives in&nbsp;the movie industry.</p><p><h2>Early acting career</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d82/18b/93e04b5263b668fa2cfdd47d7a.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;did theater in&nbsp;college and knew since&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;child that&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;act,” Andie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>. She made her dream come true in&nbsp;1984 when she filmed the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Greystoke: The Legend of&nbsp;Tarzan, Lord of&nbsp;the Apes</i></a>. However, <strong>her triumph was clouded by&nbsp;the fact that her lines were dubbed by&nbsp;another actress.</strong></p><p>What upset her the most was that no&nbsp;one complained about her performance before she learned about the vocal switch. But this only made her more determined to&nbsp;prove herself in&nbsp;the industry. “I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;fight really hard. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;just took a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;classes and worked on&nbsp;every aspect of&nbsp;myself,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7e/986/7f6ba35481bca46154896654ac.jpg><p>Andie and Emilio Estevez in&nbsp;the movie <i>St. Elmo’s Fire</i><br></p><p>Her breakthrough role was in&nbsp;the romantic drama <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>St. Elmo’s Fire</i></a>. Andie was 27&nbsp;at the time. She played a&nbsp;doctor who was courted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;law student who is&nbsp;in&nbsp;love with her.</p><p><h2>The peak of&nbsp;her career</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad3/9b1/f20afa59aaab71f2c99ce20a80.jpg><p>The early 1990s were a&nbsp;high point for the actress. She rose to&nbsp;fame in&nbsp;1993 after she played Rita, the&nbsp;TV producer that Phil, the meteorologist, is&nbsp;in&nbsp;love with, in&nbsp;the comedy <i>Groundhog Day</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/194/552/f168e45625b463bd63a36cd139.jpg><p>Aside from that, there were also the comedies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Green Card</i></a> starring Gérard Depardieu and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Four Weddings and a&nbsp;Funeral</i></a> starring Hugh Grant, which were very popular in&nbsp;the ’90s. In&nbsp;<i>Green Card</i>, Andie played a&nbsp;horticulturalist and an&nbsp;environmentalist, and in&nbsp;<i>Four Weddings and a&nbsp;Funeral</i>, she played the love interest of&nbsp;the main character who she met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding.</p><p><h2>First marriage and kids</h2></p><p>Andie with her husband Paul Qualley</p><p>By&nbsp;the time she reached the peak of&nbsp;her career, the actress had already married Paul Qualley. They met while posing for commercial ads&nbsp;— he&nbsp;also worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model. Even though Andie said she didn’t plan to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have</a> children, she and Paul had a&nbsp;son and 2&nbsp;daughters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/646/cd5/e54611569698bfa18c989f7d0c.jpg><p>Andie with her son Justin<br></p><p>According to&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a> Margaret, Andie and Paul were very different. Paul was against modern technologies, his house “<strong>had no&nbsp;TV, no&nbsp;computers, no&nbsp;Wi-Fi, no&nbsp;microwaves</strong>,” while Andie preferred a&nbsp;more modern approach to&nbsp;life and technology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62c/dc3/52daf950169da22a9640c9f095.jpg><p>Andie with her daughters Rainey and Margaret</p><p>Rainey and Margaret followed in&nbsp;their mother’s footsteps and became actresses.

She’s also a&nbsp;singer, she releases and writes music under the name Rainsford.</p><p>Her younger daughter, Margaret, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for an&nbsp;Emmy and Golden Globe, and played in&nbsp;popular movies like, <i>The Nice Guys</i> and <i>Once Upon a&nbsp;Time in&nbsp;Hollywood</i>.</p><p><h2>Failures in&nbsp;her personal life and career</h2></p><p>Andie and her second husband Rhett Hartzog</p><p>In&nbsp;summer 1999, Andie met her former high school classmate, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>businessman</a> named Rhett Hartzog. Soon after, he&nbsp;proposed to&nbsp;her. <strong>“I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;secret crush on&nbsp;her in&nbsp;high school,”</strong> he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. They got married in&nbsp;2001, but divorced 3&nbsp;years later.</p><p>“The sooner you release your anger, the better for you. Life goes on&nbsp;even after divorce,” the actress said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fa/db5/477353505f9d19e4b327300fa0.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>period</a> not only in&nbsp;Andie’s personal life but also in&nbsp;her career. A&nbsp;few movies she starred in&nbsp;were failures according to&nbsp;critics and viewers. One of&nbsp;the movies, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Town &&nbsp;Country</i></a>, is&nbsp;still considered one of&nbsp;the biggest box office flops in&nbsp;film history.</p><p>“I&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;the lead, or&nbsp;I may not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>get</a> the starring roles that&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;because so&nbsp;many movies revolve around youth, but&nbsp;I refuse to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away because&nbsp;I enjoy&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;always find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;get work,” the actress would say when someone asked her about her age.</p><p><h2>Aging acceptance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad7/ed3/24594758358071c3b099217aff.jpg><p>When the actress turned&nbsp;40, a&nbsp;journalist asked her what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;age and lose beauty. Andie MacDowell got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>angry</a>, “I&nbsp;simply couldn’t believe&nbsp;it! I&nbsp;don’t feel I’m losing my&nbsp;beauty. It’s just beauty of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different kind.”</p><p>She mentioned that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>once</a> even tried Botox, but she’s since declined cosmetic work on&nbsp;her face and prefers natural beauty. “I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say, I’ve never felt more beautiful. I’m not saying that everybody has to&nbsp;go&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, but it&nbsp;suits&nbsp;me,” Andie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> when she turned&nbsp;63.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/299/ed2/82c3fc568299d8381cb5d9f13d.png><p>Andie and her daughter Rainey<br></p><p>Nowadays, she draws the attention of&nbsp;the audience not only with her talent, but also with her positive attitude toward aging. Andie MacDowell’s gorgeous brown curls have always been her trademark. And everyone got really surprised when, in&nbsp;2021, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> on&nbsp;the red carpet of&nbsp;the Cannes Film Festival with her gray hair.</p><p>Later, Andie confessed that when she had a&nbsp;break from her work, she stopped dyeing&nbsp;it. And when her children saw her natural hair color, they encouraged her to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;because they thought it&nbsp;was cool. When the actress informed her managers about her makeover, they began to&nbsp;object. So, Andie got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>indignant</a>, <strong>“Why is&nbsp;my&nbsp;gray hair an&nbsp;issue and George Clooney’s isn’t?”</strong> She eventually got it&nbsp;her own way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6fe/e3a/83b92c59598f6a10f414e73161.jpg><p>“It&nbsp;goes in&nbsp;waves. Because you feel like it’s all over, and you’ll never work again, and you’re terrified. Then all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, people like something you&nbsp;do, and you get a&nbsp;great script and feel revived, like, ’Oh wow, okay. I’m not dead yet,’” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><p>It’s true. Soon we’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;few <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>projects</a> featuring Andie.
