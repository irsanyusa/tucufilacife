According to the National Father’s Day Committee, the first Father’s Day was celebrated in Dodd’s town of Spokane, Wash., in 1910. The holiday’s June date is tied to Smart’s birthday of June 5.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That was just two years after the first Mother’s Day, which had been proposed by <a href=#>Anna M. Jarvis</a>, took place in 1908. But, while “Mother’s Day took off like a rocket, Father’s Day took off like a rock,” according to Ralph LaRossa, author of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Modernization of Fatherhood</a> and sociology professor at Georgia State University.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Mother’s Day was to convey that mothers were particularly special, but it seemed to some that it was antithetical to say fathers were special as well,” LaRossa says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Six years after its first celebration, Mother’s Day was acknowledged by President Woodrow Wilson, who signed a proclamation on May 9, 1914, declaring the second Sunday of May “a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.” Father’s Day hardly got the same treatment: in 1916, Wilson simply pressed a button in the Oval Office that rolled out a flag in Washington at a Father’s Day celebration. Similarly, President Calvin Coolidge wouldn’t sign a proclamation in 1924, even though he suggested the holiday be observed nationwide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There was pushback, though, says LaRossa. For example, one man named Robert Spero proposed that, instead of adding a day for dads, Mother’s Day be replaced with a Parents’ Day that acknowledging both parents. “We should all have love for dad and mother every day, but Parent’s Day on the second Sunday in May is a reminder that both parents should be loved and respected together,” Spere, who was known as Uncle Robert, told the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times in 1931</a>. Parents’ Day rallies, however, didn’t make their way out of the 1940s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And as the role of fathers transformed across America, the Father’s Day holiday eventually earned its place alongside Mother’s Day. In <a href=# rel=noopener>1972,</a> Father’s Day was given the recognition of a proclamation from Richard Nixon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZta2Zshnp8jp%2BYraCVp8BusMCyZKGho6m8s8WMqKmin5mjfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./baby-name-predictor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Popular Will Your Name Be in 25 Years?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bobrisky-cross-dressing-star-continues-to-milk-his-fleeting-fame.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cross-dressing star continues to milk his fleeting fame</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
