But the far-right Chega grabbed much of the spotlight with a strong third-place result. It won 12 seats in parliament just two years ago. Now, it has close to 50 seats.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>All the Elections Around the World in 2024</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chega, which translates as “Enough,” is led by 41-year-old Andre Ventura, a former trainee priest who later became a television football commentator. He said late Sunday that Chega’s election success means it should be part of any AD-led government.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is a victory that needs to be heard in many places tonight,” Ventura said as he waved and jumped in front of his supporters who chanted ‘victory, victory, victory.’</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The will of the Portuguese was clear,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Having secured a huge increase in parliament seats, Chega is a mathematical option for the center-right, as together they would have an outright majority.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the populist party is controversial, with a tough anti-immigration stance and support for chemical castration for some sex offenders. During the election campaign, AD leader Luis Montenegro ruled out doing a deal with Chega, which he calls racist and xenophobic. He reaffirmed the commitment after the election.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even if Chega is kept isolated, with Sunday’s performance it cemented its position as the third-biggest party in parliament and a powerful political presence in Portugal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chega’s gains symbolize a massive shift. A majority-Socialist government was overturned and the parliament will now be dominated by right-of-center parties. Combined, they will have at least 135 seats out of 230. Four seats, allocated to voters outside Portugal, have yet to be decided.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the early hours of Monday morning, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos conceded defeat. But the AD, which groups the Social Democratic Party (PSD) with the smaller CDS, is well short of a parliamentary majority. Santos said the AD shouldn’t count on his party for support in parliament.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That means Portugal is heading for a minority government that may be forced to compromise on key policies to get support from other parties. And it may struggle to survive if history is any guide. Since Portugal became a democracy 50 years ago, only two minority governments have lasted a full term.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In its election manifesto, the AD alliance said there’s a need to transform the economy, which is stuck with low wages, high taxes and a housing crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It wants to cut income taxes as well as taxes on home purchases for young people, addressing voter concerns including the lack of affordable housing and the emigration of qualified young people. It also plans to gradually reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">European trend</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chega’s surge, part of a trend seen in countries including the <a href=#>Netherlands</a>, France and <a href=#>Germany</a>, comes just three months before European Union elections, where populist groups are expected to make further gains. Ventura has built relations with other right-wing parties, including Vox in neighboring Spain, which congratulated him in a post on X.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chega secured 18% of the vote in Portugal on Sunday, up from 7% just two years ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s appealed to a growing number of disgruntled voters by blaming successive left-wing and center-right governments for what he says is systemic corruption in Portugal. In one video on Chega’s website, Ventura he said he would “clean up Portugal from the Socialists and Social Democrats.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those two parties have dominated Portuguese politics since the Carnation Revolution 50 years ago, when more than four decades of dictatorship ended.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Confrontational&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ventura first appeared on the political scene as a candidate for the PSD in 2017 during regional elections in Loures, on the outskirts of Lisbon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He drew attention by targeting the Roma community, claiming they were almost exclusively dependent on state subsidies. He lost that election and then left the PSD to form Chega in 2019.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His tone in parliament is often confrontational, which he says is meant to channel the anger that Portuguese people feel about the system. A Eurobarometer survey in 2023 found that 93% of Portuguese citizens consider corruption to be widespread.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have the worst government and the worst-ever prime minister,” Ventura said last year, words that echo how another populist, Donald Trump, describes rivals including President Joe Biden.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His focus on corruption hit home when former Prime Minister Antonio Costa resigned late last year amid a scandal in government over allegations of influence peddling. That triggered the early elections.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is a huge rot that is spreading throughout the country,” Ventura told supporters at a rally earlier this year. “Only we can do something about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcGlug3F%2Fjqmmq6ylnK6tec%2BaqaWhkaKyr8CMnqOem6SevK95wqGcoJldpa6zwNhmp6iopaG2tMCMnqyrp6CaerO1xqGraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./une-longue-treve.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Une bien longue trve...</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-kidman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Kidman (Actress) - On This Day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
