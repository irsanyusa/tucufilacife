It&nbsp;looks eerie&nbsp;— is&nbsp;it&nbsp;some form of&nbsp;witchcraft? Or&nbsp;was it&nbsp;simply produced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;smoke machine? Well, this phenomenon is&nbsp;far less mysterious than you might have already imagined. This smoke ring was spotted over the village of&nbsp;Shortandy in&nbsp;Kazakhstan. The O-shaped structure floated in&nbsp;the air for about 15&nbsp;minutes and then disappeared. A&nbsp;similar ring was seen some time later in&nbsp;Britain. It&nbsp;was named “The Black Ring of&nbsp;Leamington Spa.” Turned out it&nbsp;was produced during a&nbsp;fireworks test over Warwick Castle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/203/363/aca50e5f709bcdbc3170fb412a.png><p>Another pyrotechnic test caused the same smoke ring to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;the sky over <a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a> in&nbsp;2013. And a&nbsp;year earlier, in&nbsp;2012, a&nbsp;very similar smoke formation appeared over Chicago as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;an&nbsp;electrical transformer blow-up. For such a&nbsp;vortex to&nbsp;occur, a&nbsp;blast should pass through a&nbsp;circular structure, for example, a&nbsp;factory smokestack. Now, look at&nbsp;this bizarre weather phenomenon! Doesn’t it&nbsp;look like... falling clouds? They were captured on&nbsp;video in&nbsp;Morocco: a&nbsp;large region was covered with a&nbsp;thick, foam-like substance. Large chunks of&nbsp;this substance were either falling to&nbsp;the ground or&nbsp;getting raised into the air by&nbsp;gusts of&nbsp;wind. It’s still unclear what these “falling clouds” are. Some meteorologists believe that the material&nbsp;is, indeed, artificial foam since the “clouds” can’t seem to&nbsp;settle down.</p><p>This red sky sure looks absolutely terrifying. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;what the end of&nbsp;the world looks like? The residents of&nbsp;the Chinese city where the phenomenon was observed got quite a&nbsp;scare after seeing mysterious blood-red skies. But the explanation for this natural phenomenon is&nbsp;simple and prosaic. Experts claim that such colors were caused by&nbsp;the refraction and scattering of&nbsp;light. And the light itself could be&nbsp;coming from ships in&nbsp;the local port. In&nbsp;the videos, we&nbsp;can see that the sky is&nbsp;the most crimson exactly over the port. This magic outside Hogwarts is&nbsp;called red sprites. Those are colorful lightning flashes that occur high above thunderstorm clouds. This phenomenon had been dismissed as&nbsp;fiction for decades&nbsp;— until scientists caught it&nbsp;on&nbsp;film. And since then, sprites have been recorded thousands of&nbsp;times. Oops!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/771/756/3097a45e53afded6df75369769.png><p>Red sprites are massive electrical discharges that take different shapes. They look like luminous reddish-orange flashes. Red sprites last for a&nbsp;mere fraction of&nbsp;a&nbsp;second and occur after strong lightning strikes, soaring up&nbsp;to&nbsp;60&nbsp;miles in&nbsp;the air. They’re usually caused by&nbsp;the discharges of&nbsp;positive lightning between the ground and a&nbsp;thundercloud. In&nbsp;March 2018, people who looked up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the sky in&nbsp;Northern Nevada could see the rarest and most bizarre cloud ever&nbsp;— a&nbsp;horseshoe cloud.</p><p>Unless you know the scientific explanation of&nbsp;this phenomenon, it&nbsp;can scare and puzzle even the most experienced sky-watchers. But meteorologists know that such a&nbsp;horseshoe vortex happens when a&nbsp;flat cloud travels over a&nbsp;column of&nbsp;warm rising air. This air not only gives the cloud its impressive shape but also adds some spin to&nbsp;its movement. Unfortunately, such clouds are very fleeting and usually last for only several minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b66/6ef/9e3a6a5757adf85e25124e6f59.png><p>Breathtaking rainbow clouds appear on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;cotton-like, puffy clouds after thunderstorms. The puffy clouds are low-altitude ones. They usually hover at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;around 6,000&nbsp;ft. When the water vapor they contain condenses, the resulting droplets act as&nbsp;prisms. This forms multi-colored caps over the clouds. Morning glory clouds are extremely rare. They look like massive tubes stretching across the sky. They can snake for more than 600&nbsp;miles, sitting relatively low. Most researchers agree that these clouds appear when an&nbsp;updraft squeezes through the cloud. This creates the signature rolling appearance. The cool air at&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;the cloud makes it&nbsp;sink downward. The best (but not the only) place to&nbsp;see morning glory is&nbsp;Australia’s Gulf of&nbsp;Carpentaria. If&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;travel there to&nbsp;see these clouds, choose a&nbsp;period from late September to&nbsp;early November.</p><p>Blood rain looks terrifying&nbsp;— unless you know what it&nbsp;is. In&nbsp;reality, there’s nothing strange or&nbsp;unnatural about this weather phenomenon. People have known about such scarlet-tinted rains since the times of&nbsp;Ancient Rome. Sometimes, powerful winds lift red dust into the atmosphere and carry it&nbsp;far, far away. In&nbsp;the end, this dust gets mixed with clouds, which colors the rain. By&nbsp;the way, dust from coal mines can make the rain black. Pollen is&nbsp;responsible for yellow rains. And some other kinds of&nbsp;dust can turn rainwater white.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/463/793/4777855d2fa96cc8e5148f6ecf.png><p>In&nbsp;Denmark, people experience blackout-type effects on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty regular basis. Just look how weird it&nbsp;is! But it&nbsp;gets even more bizarre when you find out that it’s birds who are responsible for this unusual phenomenon. Every spring and fall, millions of&nbsp;starlings begin their annual migration from Sweden, Finland, and Norway toward Britain, Belgium, and France. And Denmark is&nbsp;the lucky place where you can observe Sort Sol (which is&nbsp;the Danish name for Black Sun).</p><p>The birds travel in&nbsp;large flocks&nbsp;— this way, it’s easier to&nbsp;exchange information and stay warm. Before the birds land, the flock performs movements that look like dancing. But this is&nbsp;just starlings moving together and creating different formations to&nbsp;shoo predators away. And although the birds fly in&nbsp;highly synchronized patterns, people think that the huge flock changes its shape chaotically. “Black Sun” only lasts 20&nbsp;minutes at&nbsp;sunset, and you have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;either fast or&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;see this phenomenon. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;storm holds back your long-awaited picnic, keep calm and think about how lucky you are that it’s not the Catatumbo&nbsp;— the world’s longest lightning storm! The heart of&nbsp;the storm, which repeats every year, is&nbsp;over Lake Maracaibo in&nbsp;Venezuela, and it&nbsp;towers way higher than your regular thunderstorm. This natural phenomenon lasts for a&nbsp;whopping 140 to&nbsp;160 days and creates more than 280 lightning strikes a&nbsp;day!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/99a/406/3eda075c22aa4a634226e41d0a.png><p>You’ve probably heard how they say that lightning doesn’t strike twice in&nbsp;the same place. Well, the Catatumbo storm seems not to&nbsp;know about this rule. Or, at&nbsp;least, it&nbsp;doesn’t prevent storm clouds from gathering in&nbsp;the very same place, year after year. Ever seen huge round discs in&nbsp;the sky? Most likely, those were lenticular clouds. They usually form over large and high places, like mountains or&nbsp;hills. When strong wind bumps into some barrier, this creates a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;air. The air kinda wraps around the obstacle. And the higher the barrier&nbsp;is, the colder the air that’s rising over it&nbsp;becomes. At&nbsp;some point, the moisture it&nbsp;contains turns into water droplets. And they form these unusual clouds. Lenticular clouds can look like waves, a&nbsp;pizza, or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;stack of&nbsp;pancakes.</p><p>In&nbsp;Australia, it&nbsp;sometimes rains spiders. That’s because these creatures can “balloon”! It’s a&nbsp;highly unusual way of&nbsp;traveling. A&nbsp;spider climbs to&nbsp;the very top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tall tree or&nbsp;shrub. And then, it&nbsp;spins several strands of&nbsp;silk, which then help the spider to&nbsp;be&nbsp;carried away by&nbsp;the wind. It’s not easy to&nbsp;spot “ballooning” spiders. But sometimes, when the weather is&nbsp;especially damp and unpleasant, “mass ballooning” occurs. Millions of&nbsp;spiders set off on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;find another place with better conditions. It&nbsp;may look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s snowing outside. But no&nbsp;— those are spiders drifting down to&nbsp;the ground. Huge white lumps over your head are called Mammatus clouds. They can make you believe the sky is&nbsp;falling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/767/169/175d405b50838ea009f45f6536.png><p>Most clouds form when air rises into the atmosphere, but not Mammatus ones. They appear when moist and cool air goes down and mixes with dry air. The result&nbsp;— unique puffed-rice clouds. By&nbsp;the way, if&nbsp;you spot this phenomenon, bad weather is&nbsp;just around the corner. Moonbows are a&nbsp;much rarer phenomenon than rainbows. They’re caused by&nbsp;moonlight rather than direct sunlight and only occur when the Moon is&nbsp;near-full. Moonbows are dim and often seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;white. But it’s just an&nbsp;illusion. The human eye is&nbsp;just not sensitive enough to&nbsp;catch all the colors.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmmKudXam1sL%2FEZqSyq6Sav6q71Kxkm6SRmLhuvsinnqxlkaG5brvVnqlmrJiaeri70aWbZnBhan15hI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./afrobeats-star-asake-dazzle-listeners-in-o2-arena-concert.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Afrobeats star Asake dazzle listeners in O2 Arena concert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./territoires-energie-positive-une-circulaire-fait-leffet-dun-tremblement-de-terre.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>une circulaire fait l'effet d'un tremblement de terre</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
