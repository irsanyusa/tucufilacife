Their sale in countries like Sweden and Norway was made illegal years ago, but in Finland people still eat it with gusto.</p><p>Great Big Story recently featured an interesting video on the popularity of False Morels in Finland, the takeaway of which is that processing them properly makes these mushrooms relatively safe to consume. There are still those who claim that gyromitrin builds up in your system over long periods and can cause serious health problems, so the consensus is that if you just can’t give up false morels, you should at least not eat them regularly.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Reminiscent of a human brain – especially when sliced in half – false morels must first be rinsed in plenty of cold water (one liter for every 50 grams of mushrooms) for several hours, two at least. They must be boiled in plenty of water (at least three parts water for every one-part mushrooms) for about ten minutes, five minutes minimum. During this step, the person doing the cooking must be careful not to inhale the fumes from the pot, as they can reportedly carry gyromitrin as well.</p><p>After the first round of boiling, the mushrooms must be drained in a colander and rinsed in running cold water. Then the boiling and rinsing steps must be repeated before the false morels can be consumed or used as ingredients in various dishes. Even after going through all these steps, there may still be traces of gyromitrin in the mushrooms, which, as previously mentioned, could build up in the body over time.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-1c2131ea-eeec-42db-bf8b-8e279c886b36 data-caption="People are eating this potentially deadly mushroom although it’s banned across the world"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6ecktkpTURBXy9jNWY5Yjg4NTY0OWNjZTg5YTAzZmEwMTQxMmQ5NDAwNi5qcGeRlQLNAqnNBADCww></span><p>According to the Nordic Recipe Archive, “one should never stay in a confined space together with fresh false morels, like inside a car or in a poorly ventilated room. People have been known to have headaches and nausea caused by the toxic false morel fumes when travelling in a car with a basket of these mushrooms beside them.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At one point it was believed that drying false morels made them safe for consumption, but studies have found that to be false. Therefore, dried mushrooms must be processed just like fresh ones after being reconstituted.</p><p>Gyromitrin poisoning can cause various gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, with severe cases leading to liver and kidney damage as well as seizures and coma, and, in extreme cases, even death.</p><p>Despite the danger posed by eating or even being near false morel mushrooms, in Finland they are used as ingredients in Michelin star restaurants and even sold as canned goods in the supermarket.</p><p>Their sale is however strictly regulated by authorities: warning signs must be placed in the aisles where they are sold, and their packaging must contain a leaflet with processing and cooking instructions.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Source: Odditycentral.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLzEqKelnV2Wv6Z5xJqroqaXYrS6vs6moK2qkWKytK%2FUpZynrJFivLN506GcZp6RocCmecyoqZ6kXZa5tbTOrp6hZZmpwG6uwKelnpxfZcCugcqbaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnant-women-hate-it-when-people-touch-their-belly-and-heres-why-796446.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Women Hate It When People Touch Their Belly, and Heres Why</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-found-glory-good-charlotte-1200541196.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Found Glory, Good Charlotte</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
