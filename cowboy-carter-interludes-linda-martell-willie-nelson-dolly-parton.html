Its rich narrative plays out across the expanse of 27 tracks that include not just songs, but spoken interludes. For the album, which released early Friday morning, Beyoncé invites listeners to tune in to a fictional radio station, KNTRY Radio Texas (a cheeky play on the fictional broadcast news station, KNTY News, that she debuted as part of her Renaissance world tour set), where different radio shows are hosted by some of the biggest names in country music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Cowboy Carter, you'll find country icon Dolly Parton riffing about "that hussy with the good hair" before introducing <a href=#>Beyoncé's take on her legendary song, "Jolene,"</a> Country Music Hall of Famer Willie Nelson hosting an hour aptly titled <a href=#>"Smoke Show,"</a> and <a href=#>pioneering Black country artist</a> Linda Martell hosting an eponymous show, all on KNTRY Radio. By tapping these stars for interludes, Beyoncé firmly positions herself in the country space with an eye toward the future, while honoring the legends who have come before her. The inclusion of Martell is especially significant, as she was the first female Black artist to enter the Top 25 on Billboard's country charts, back in 1969, as well as the first Black woman to perform at the Grand Ole Opry; last month, with her single "Texas Hold 'Em," Beyoncé became the first Black woman to hit number one on the Billboard Hot Country chart.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read more about each of the country stars featured on Cowboy Carter's interludes and the symbolism behind their appearances.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=#>How Beyoncé Changed the Music Industry</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Dolly Parton</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dolly Parton appears on an interlude track titled "Dolly P," which leads into Beyoncé's spirited reimagining of "Jolene." On the track, she addresses Beyoncé as "Miss Honey B" and herself as "Dolly P," and jokingly calls Becky with the good hair, the villainous other woman from Lemonade, "that hussy with the good hair," before comparing her to the auburn-haired Jolene.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyoncé's cover of "Jolene" is something Parton had anticipated for a while; during a 2022 appearance on <a href=#>The Daily Show</a>, Parton told Trevor Noah that she hoped Beyoncé would cover it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I would just love to hear 'Jolene' done in just a big way, kind of like how Whitney [Houston] did my ‘I Will Always Love You,’ just someone that can take my little songs and make them like powerhouses," she said. "That would be a marvelous day in my life if [Beyoncé] ever does do ‘Jolene.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Parton has also been a vocal supporter of Beyoncé ahead of Cowboy Carter's release, from congratulating her via Instagram for "Texas Hold 'Em" going number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart to showing love during a recent interview with <a href=#>Knox News</a>, in which Parton enthusiastically praised her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I love her!" she said in the interview. “She's a beautiful girl and a great singer.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Parton also appears on the beginning of the track "Tyrant," where she addresses Bey as "Cowboy Carter" and encourages her to "strike a match and light up this juke joint!"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Willie Nelson</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the album, Beyoncé's fellow Texas native Willie Nelson hosts a "Smoke Hour" which is featured on two tracks, "Smoke Hour * Willie Nelson" and "Smoke Hour II." Nelson's first interlude is the first track on the album to introduce KNTRY Radio Texas; in the beginning of the clip, static can be heard as someone flips through radio stations, playing snippets of Son House's “Don’t You Mind People Grinnin' In Your Face," Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s “Down by the River Side,” Chuck Berry’s “Maybellene,” and Roy Hamilton's "Don’t Let Go." The clips are fitting, as these songs were performed by Black artists who were pioneers in their genres but were largely overlooked by music history. A major theme of Cowboy Carter and Beyoncé's larger three-act project has been to shine a light on representation in music history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nelson's inclusion on the album is meaningful, especially when considering his place in country music history. A pioneer of "outlaw country," Nelson has achieved accolades in the genre, but has often been at odds with the conservative values associated with country music, as a vocal advocate of marijuana legalization, LGBTQ+ rights, and Democratic politics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Nelson's second interlude is a pointed message about looking beyond conventions, another theme of the album, which defies easy categorization, especially when it comes to genre. In addition to country sounds, the album nods to gospel, trap, rap, pop, rock, and even Irish folk music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"If there’s one thing you can take away from my set today, let it be this: Sometimes you don't know what you like until someone you trust turns you on to some real good sh-t."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>Beyoncé Is Boldly Defying Country’s Stereotypes</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Linda Martell</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of all the interludes on Cowboy Carter, Martell's may hold the most symbolism. Though Martell released just one album, 1970's Color Me Country, she was one of country's first Black woman stars, becoming the first Black female artist to enter the Top 25 of Billboard's country charts in 1969 with her song "Color Him Father." She was also the first Black woman to perform on the Grand Ole Opry stage. Martell's career was hindered after she left the label she was signed to, Plantation Records, because of its name. Martell, now 82, has said <a href=#>she was blackballed</a> in the industry by the label's owner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her interlude track for the album, "The Linda Martell Show," Martell addresses the limitations of boxing an artist into just one genre. It's an issue that's followed Beyoncé throughout her career, especially when it comes to winning awards. Beyoncé and other successful artists of color have often won in genre-specific categories, but have failed to win as many awards in major genre-spanning categories, despite the popularity of their music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"This particular tune stretches across a range of genres," Martell says in the interlude. "And that's what makes it a unique listening experience."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Martell echoes her sentiment on the beginning of "Spaghettii," where she remarks: "Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? Yes, they are. In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand, but in practice, well, some may feel confined." Martell's interlude leads into one of the most genre-defiant songs on the album, with Beyoncé rapping on the track and featuring Shaboozey, a singer and artist who's known for bridging hip-hop and country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZmhXV9jpymsJqfrnqkrdGtnKtlmaPBpr7Lrpueq12htq%2BwwGakmqqkmrmtedaio6WhlWK7prjSqKVmnJ%2Bhubp5z5qpraeeZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./experimentation-de-la-formation-professionnelle-des-detenus-en-aquitaine-un-succes-dapres-alain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>un &amp;quot;succs&amp;quot; d'aprs Alain Rousset</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./official-coronation-dates-set-for-new-soun-of-ogbomoso.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Official coronation dates set for new Soun of Ogbomoso</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
