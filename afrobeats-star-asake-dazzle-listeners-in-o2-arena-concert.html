An inbuilt talent developed in OAU at the<strong> </strong>Dramatic Art's Pit Theatre Hall and the gruelling stage that's Amphitheatre.</p><p>Assisted by the celebrated band the <strong>Compozers</strong>, Asake dazzled fans not only with his hit songs but with his compelling presence.</p><p>When he performed one of his early releases, those who followed him before he became a household name basked in nostalgia for the journey and how far he had come. And when he started rolling out the hits, 20,000 fans sang along to every word, absolved every moment, and made it clear he was deserving of his success.</p><p>Asake's fortunes changed when he met Nigerian Hip Hop legend <strong>Olamide Baddo </strong>who signed him to his <strong>YBNL </strong>imprint. Together they formed a formidable partnership that delivered what is the greatest one-year run in Afrobeats. A momentum Asake continued into 2023 with the release of his successful sophomore album<strong> </strong><a href=# id=d9cfa31a-be54-4c91-bc92-41ae4d50f05c><strong>'Work Of Art'</strong> </a>and a mind-blowing feat of selling out the O2.</p><p>Asake and Olamide's impressive partnership was recreated on the O2 stage when the duo performed 'Omo Ope' the record with which it all began. When Olamide leaned in to whisper into Asake's ears, one can imagine it was a moment when the teacher took great pride in his student.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At the concert, former YBNL signee and Street-Hop maestro <strong>Lil Kesh </strong>thrilled the audience. So did YBNL international sensation <strong>Fireboy</strong> who's also a product of the same alma mater as Asake.</p><p>The man of the moment brought out <strong>Tiwa</strong> <strong>Savage</strong> for their hit collaboration 'Loaded'. He dazzled fans with his performance of 'Blessings' with American sensation <strong>Fridayy</strong>. And he added class to the event when he brought out <strong>Tunde</strong> <strong>Baiyewu</strong> of <strong>Lighthouse</strong> <strong>Family</strong> to perform 'Ocean Drive', the song he sampled on 'Sunshine'.</p><p>Even though the show ended rather abruptly for the over 80,000 fans watching it live on YouTube, the concert offered everything it promised.</p><p>Asake's O2 Arena concert was a chance to be part of his surreal rise from relative obscurity to superstardom. A chance to be part of the making of a cinematic masterpiece. And for most people, the moment was enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6anaunkpqutb%2BMrKuaql2WwKK3xGabmrKqobJuuMisq56mlafAbrXNZqZrZZGnsq%2BtjJymp5uVp8FwrsybsG1wlg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chalon-sur-saone-supprime-le-menu-de-substitution-au-porc-dans-ses-cantines-scolaires.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chalon-sur-Sane supprime le menu de substitution au porc dans ses cantines scolaires</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-are-those-mysterious-black-rings-all-over-the-world-815088.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Are Those Mysterious Black Rings All Over the World?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1587642-whimsical-costume-party-ideas-fabulous-event.html>33 whimsical costume party ideas for the most fabulous event</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./des-masques-transparents-pour-les-personnels-des-maternelles-du-handicap-et-des-creches.html>Des masques transparents pour les personnels des maternelles, du handicap et des crches</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./suppression-de-la-cvae-doutes-des-elus-locaux-sur-la-perennite-dune-partie-de-la-compensation.html>doutes des lus locaux sur la prennit d'une partie de la compensation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./octavia-spencer-kent-state-university-graduation-commencement.html>Graduation 2017: Octavia Spencer Speech at Kent State</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./im-obsessed-with-my-husbands-mistress-my-husband-doesnt-even-know-about-it-818599.html>Im Obsessed With My Husbands Mistress, My Husband Doesnt Even Know About It</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
